1. The Contents of the several Chapters in the Discourse ensuing.

1. Errata in the Preface.

1. Errata in the running Titles.

#####Body#####

1. The occasion of the briefness of the Treatise. Who they are that most oppose the Doctrine of General Attonement, and why. Truth in what respect obnoxious to opposition. How it ought to be vindicated, that the generality of people may be convinced. Satans policie to engage persons of greatest esteem in the Church, against some important Truth.
THE occasion of the brief Discourse ensuing (or rather of the briefness of it) was my want of time, 
    _ CHAP. II. Mr. Resbury his Lightless Starre. His design to confute Reason. His mistake of often routed, for, often houted, errors. His undue charge of consequentiall Blasphemies: immodest expressions, Pelagianisme. His fond Triumphs. A small Treatise printed 1631. Entituled, an Historicall Narration, &c. His Exposition of the Parable of the Talents.

    _ CHAP. 3. The great cry and clamour of Mr. Resburies Pamphlet. His shameless falsifieations and misreports of the Opinions of his Adversaries; an unworthiness very incident to men of his Opinions. His Childish malignity.

    _ CHAP. IV. Mr. Resburies put off of what he is not able to answer. Quarrels against his own, whether shadow, or substance. Reason, according to Mr. Resburies own sayings, ought to interpose, yea and arbitrate, in matters of Religion.

    _ CHAP. V. Concerning Mr. Pawsons Title of his Sermon, a Vindication of free Grace. Mr. Pawson, Mr. Resburie, and Mr. Kendall, compared. The reproach of Arminianisme, and Definition. Somewhat (occasionally) concerning the Triumvirate of Mr. Kendalls Printers. Eph. 1.4. in part opened.

    _ CHAP. VI. Of the Decree and Act of God in Electing. Election alwayes carrieth Salvation along with it. No inconvenience in supposing a possibility that all might perish, it being supposed with all, that all might be saved. Nor in supposing Christ an Head without a Body, &c. Bug-beares made of sober and harmless sayings. Whether Mr. Pawson, or the Authour, holds 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 credere. The Authour unjustly charged about Christs not bearing the curse of the Law.

    _ CHAP. VII. Mr. Pawson teacheth, that men are not justified by believing on Christ. Intentions of God often expressed in Scripture by words signifying the Acts or dispensations themselves. Beza's Exposition of the word, elected, Eph. 1.4. A brief touch upon 1 Pet. 1.2. As also upon 1 John 3.9. Concerning the death and merits of Christ.

    _ CHAP. VIII. In what sense it is true, that God by one Act produceth all things. Concerning differencing Grace. Of boasting in a mans self. Of the true, and false Doctrine of free Grace. Philip. 1.29. in part opened. Whether 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, 1 Cor. 2.15. signifies the natural man, or weak Christian. In what both Mr. Pawsons, and Mr. Kendalls chief strength lieth.

    _ CHAP. IX. The two Recommendatories before Mr. Kendalls Book. Nec te quaesiveris extra, wanting amongst the shreds of Mr. Kendalls Poetry. Mr. Kendall and his Book importunely magnified.

    _ CHAP. X. Concerning the two Titles of Mr. Kendalls Book. Error can have no better foundation, than loose Earth or Sand. Mr. Kendalls Book brought forth into the world, with great difficulty. Whether he asserteth the Doctrine commonly received in the Reformed Churches? Not needful that Mr. Kendall should meddle too much with my 19. Chapter. Mr. Kendalls policic in refusing to own his Book, till his Printers Errata be amended. Whether the Logick of the Holy Ghost be contrary to that of the natural man? The special ingredients in Mr. Kendalls Book.

    _ CHAP. XI. A tast of Mr. Kendalls false and forged charges. Mr. Kendall fighteth not more against false, then forged Opinions. Whether the Authour preferreth the weight of one of his Arguments, above the weight of Doctor Prideaux Chayre. Concerning the Prerogative of God, whether Mr. Kendall, or his Adversaries, speak more honourably of it.

    _ CHAP. XII. An Enterview of some of Mr. Kendal's erroneous Principles. That the Logick of the Holy Ghost, is of a different, yea contrary nature, to that of the natural man. That without Christ's actual dying, we could not possibly be saved. That in Scripture-Logick, inability is a ground for exhortation unto duty. That God doth nothing but what is just, eo nomine, because he doth it. That God's love to man, and the death of the Son of God for him, is a Mystery too high to be reach'd, yea to be received, by the natural man. That the Action, by which God produceth any thing, is really the same with the thing produced. That knowledg and fore-knowledg are properly in God. That the Decrees of God determine every man.

    _ CHAP. XIII. A first-fruits of the great Harvest of Mr. Kendal's simple and inconsiderate passages and sayings. Whether Gods Will be the Reason of his Counsel? Mr. Kendal in stead of the love of Christ, Ephes. 3.18. interprets the Cross of Christ. Whether God hath always used the weak things of the world to confound the mighty? Concerning a meer natural man. Whether it be proper, or Clerk-like, to ascribe transient operations unto God, or whether these be the essences of the things produced by God? Whether by ascribing one great creative Act unto God, I deny all power unto him? Concerning the settling of Religion by the State. Whether Mr. Kendal hath a considerable share in the dull virtue of Patience? Concerning the necessity of Christ's actual dying. Whether the Doctrine of Gods Providence be shaken, by denying that the beginnings and ends of many things are determined by him? Mr. Kendal makes the Lord Christ to speak at a lower rate, than he himself (ordinarily.) Contradicts his own Principles and Doctrines.
 Of Gods extraordinary aiding the Elect by his Spirit. Mr. Kendal understandeth not the right Method of Preaching the Gospel.

    _ CHAP. XIV. A taste of Mr. Kendal's frivolous and unmanlike Exceptions. He accuseth his Adversary, as well for new, as for stale, Observations. And that he hath necessitated him to Absurdities. He quarrels him, because he did not preach his Sermon, before he had taken his Text. His offence at him for a Passage in his Epistle before his Discourse, touching the Divine Authority of the Scriptures. For shaking the Doctrine of Gods Providence, when as himself is the Offender in this kinde. For citing either ancient, or latter Divines, for general Redemption, without shewing him where the Fathers say, He intended as much, effected as much, for them that perish, as for those that are saved. For not beleeving, that, when either the Scriptures, Fathers, late Writers, affirm that Christ died for all men, their meaning is, for all sorts of men. For his Exposition of Acts 17.30. For this Expression, The true and regular notion of a God. For using the word, Excluded, &c. For using the distinction of intentions, precedent, and subsequent, in God.

    _ CHAP. XIV. A few Instances of Mr. Ks. many contradictions; As first, That without the actual death of Christ, no possibility of Salvation, and yet sins remitted without the mediation of this death. Secondly, That the way to open mens mouths, is the way to stop them. Thirdly, he condemns his Adversaries, for what he acquits them. Fourthly, He knows not how, and yet knows how, God converteth men. Fifthly, Teacheth himself the same thing concerning a like possibility of the rest of the Apostles perishing, which there was of Judas his, and yet jeareth his Adversary for it. Sixthly, That his Adversary denieth the necessity of Christs death, and yet judgeth it necessary upon several accounts. Sevently, That a man may know that to be, which yet he cannot conceive to be. Eighthly, he maintains that, which he doth not say. Ninthly, That God punisheth none but for their sins, and yet punisheth some not for their sins. Tenthly, he complaineth of his adversarie for troubling his Reader with stale observations, and yet with innovations too. Eleventhly, that he is bold and insolent, yet sheweth much sobrietie
 in the whole cariage of his business. Twelfly, That he is a man of parts and learning; yet not fit to teach boyes in a bell-free. Thirteenthly, that he tels long stories of the infinite love of God to all men; and yet that he teacheth, that he neither loves nor hates them. Fourteenthly, that the decrees of God determine every one, and yet deprive none of their liberty, &c.

    _ CHAP. XV. Mr. K. falsifies the passages and sayings of his Adversaries: 1. About the abortions, or miscarriages of Gods intentions. 2. About Gods determining the Death of Christ. 3. Concerning the fixing of the periods of mens lives by God. 4. Concerning his denying the necessity of Christs death. 5. Concerning ends to be effected by the use of the means of salvation. 6. Concerning Gods actual making all things at first. 7. Concerning his non-knowledge of what Arminianisme is. 8. Concerning the Arminianisme of the Fathers. 9. Concerning what the damned owe unto God. 10. Concerning Election for Sanctification. 11. In transcribing Believers for Election. 12. Concerning Gods Providence. 13. Concerning the Synod of Dort. 14. Concerning Doctor Prideaux his Chair.

    _ CHAP. XVI. Containing a few Specimina of Mr. Kendalls weak and childish insultations. About Gods intentions not taking place. The one great Creative Act of God. The signification of the word, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. About the periods of mens Lives not fixed by God. About dignifying second causes. About persons born, whose Parents were not necessitated to their Generation. About Christ signified by the Oxen and Fatlings slaine. About the mistake of Antecedent for Consequent. About the saying, that true Believers never sin with their whole wills, or full consent. About some things spoken concerning the Synod of Dort.

    _ CHAP. XVII. A taste of Mr. Kendals Ʋn-Christian, sometimes ridiculous, otherwhile uncivil, and sometimes blasphemous, jearings. His refreshing with merry frolicks. His causlesly scurrilous language, and terms. His beating his adversary black and blue with a little barbarisme. He term's him a stupendious Prodigie of subtilty, and yet a loud-talking Braggadochio, and vain boaster. His jear about lana caprina, and an horse-night-cap: about being of Gods Counsel. Why men so much desire to interess God in their cause. His jear of correcting the Evangelist for Barbarisme. His Devon proverb of a shoefull of custard, &c. His Wood-cock simile, and quart of wine. His verses of Richardo and Bindo. His scoffes at worthy Mr. Horn. Concerning the Highest indignity that can be done to the God of Heaven. Master Kendal (with his) own the tantamont, of what he disclaims with indignation. Concerning God's Philanthropie, and the ground or reason of this attribute.

    _ CHAP. XVIII. A tast of such passages in Master Kendals book, which are so delivered and managed, as if they opposed the sense of his adversaries, being in the mean time fairly and fully consistent with it. His policy and reach in such a strain. About his accurate delineation and description of the right, or just soveraignty of God over men, &c. Whether God excerciseth his prerogative in any thing, but in giving and denying grace as he pleaseth. Concerning all being saved by Christs death. About his adversaries complaining of hard measure from God. Concerning an humble submission of our thoughts to all the Scripture delivers concerning God. About excercising our Faith rather then our witts, about what the Scripture delivers concerning God. About saying, The Elect shall all believe. About bastards begotten without Providence. About ungodly mens being put out of all hope of being saved by Christ. About the Elects repenting without the long-sufferance of God. Concerning the
 Distinction of voluntas signi, and voluntas beneplaciti. In Sundry texts of Scripture an ellipsis of the particle, quamvis, although. Of Gods requiring all, enableing his Elect, to repent. All circumstances considered, it is no great thing for men to repent. Wbether God, by his right of commanding, may require that of men, which he knowes they have no ability to perform. Whether men had power in Adam to repent, or believe.

    _ CHAP. XIX. A tast of Master Kendals wooden and absur'd Metaphors, Proverbs, and Similies. Of a joyned-stooles-foot. Of a piece of veale. Of the nimble runing of an empty Coach before six Barbary Horses. Of a pair of Sheeres and Mete-yard, signifying a little Philosophie. Of Salt and Pepper. Of the Marrow-bone of Matter, and the Splinters hereof. Of his Adversaries Plumes to new stuffe an old Cushion. Of an horse-night-cap, and considering Cap. Of a piece of Chaff. Of Horse-fair. Of the knack of an hackney Distintion. Of an horse-head, and horse-taile. Of drowning the Devil upon Clow-moore. Of knocking his head against a post, and crying, Good wits jump. Of a little swigg after his dry piece. Of Bishop Carletons rocket, to signifie or express his learning. Of Davenauts, Halls, Wards, Goads, scarlet hoods, signifying their learning. Of learned Stammin-pety-coates, and green aprons. Of Grogram, resembling
 the Patience of God towards Reprobates; and of broad-cloath, resembling his patience towards his Elect. Of patience partie per pale. Of a patient husband that ardently and affectionately loves his wife that cannot forbear scolding till he hath gagged her, nor biting, till he hath drawn out her teeth, &c.

    _ CHAP. XX. Some few Specimina of Master Kendals gobyes given to the main strength and stress of the arguments encountring him. Mr. Baxter takes him tardy at this turn, more then once. About things not absolutely determined by God, as to their numbers, in their production. About mens multiplying corn without Gods special providence, and individualls in some Animal species, and the restraining of their multiplication. Master Kendals making a louse signally sacred to Gods providentiall care. About Parents being determined, or necessitated, to the generation of their children. Of all mens Names and members written in Gods Book. Errour never like to want a friend in a black coat. Whether the Saints stand bound to work out their salvation with fear and trembling, in respect of themselves. Master Kendal declines the strength of my argument, to prove, that the word, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, John 3.16. doth not here
 signifie the Elect, and turneth aside in his answer, to impertinencies, and worse matters.

    _ CHAP. XXI. Master Kendals near approches unto blasphemy. He overchargeth himself with undertakings. Whether God had power to generate his Son. Concerning his ascribing transient acts, and multiplicity of acts unto God. Whether God doth all things on Earth principally. Whether the Opposition of Gods Providence was by the same providence ordained. Whether Gods intentions are not be measured by his invitations. Whether Gods intention was the principall cause of the exclusion of those, who for their unworthiness were excluded from the marriage-feast.
