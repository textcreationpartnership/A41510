            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </gap>as now he was not far from his journeyes end. The greatest part of it was form'd whilst Master <hi>Kendal</hi> onely was in being, and Doctor <hi>Kendal</hi> as yet amongst those that were not. Which (by the way) is one reason, why in my occasional mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of him in the Treatise, I rise no higher then to his title of Master. For I was loth, either on the one hand to blur or interline my copy, in so many places as I must have done, by blotting out Master, and inserting Doctor; or on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand to charge the Compositors memory with a <hi>toties quoties</hi> as he should meet with my <hi>Master,</hi> to place his <hi>Doctor,</hi> in his stead. For I neither scruple the styling him by his Academical title of Doctor; and less envy him the honour, (if there be any such thing that accrueth unto him by it.) But if I should take the liberty of that pleasance with him, which he takes with me over &amp; over without the least regret, in his writings, I could assign another reason why I should rather en-style him <hi>Master,</hi> then <hi>Doctor;</hi> and could say (with truth enough) that I find him much more magisterial, or <hi>Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> in his Books, then <hi>Doctoral,</hi> apt or able to teach. But this (I confess) is eccentrick.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> When I was in full engagement about my portraicture of Master Doctor <hi>Kendal,</hi> and hoped ere long to have drawn the last line of that piece, I was first prevented with the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of some of my friends to attempt the satisfaction of some, who (it seems) were dis-satisfied about some things relating to the present Government. To satisfie both the one and the other, I superseded my pursuit of Master <hi>Kendal</hi> for the time, and turned in to the motion of my friends, and drew up some brief Queries, in order to the end specified. This Digression, though it was short, and made no great breach upon my time, yet it occasionally involved me in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which detained my Pen somewhat longer; one of the number of the Dis-satisfied undertaking to answer my said Queries, with the salvage of their dis-satisfaction. To this answer, being delivered to me in manuscript, I judged my self a little concerned to make some reply; which according<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly I did, and published it. This was a second Diversion. Yet all this while Master <hi>Kendal</hi> was not out of my thoughts: but I made what hast I was well able, to resume the papers relating to my debates with him, which I had for a season layed aside, and hoped now to have dispatched them for the Press before any more surprisals.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> But by that time I had made some small progress in the business, I was alarm'd the third time with some of the six Beacon-firing Book-sellers, who for want (it seems) of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imployment, turn'd Informers; and for want of any thing real and true to inform the Parliament (then in being) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, layed their heads together, and formed or forged rather a period or sentence of a wicked import, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they drew up in some of my words, with much gravity and zeal of devotion they presented to the Parliament, as one of my dangerous and heinous errours. The dis-ingenuous and un-christian deportment of these men, put me to double (or rather, treble) trouble. First, I made it my request by a letter privately sent unto them, that they would pull down with their right hand, what they had built up with their left, and Christianly repair me wherein they had unchristianly
<pb facs="tcp:65873:3"/> wronged me, by acknowledging their errour or mistake, in misrepresenting me and my Doctrine to the Parliament, and (indeed) unto the world. But they instead of comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me in my soft motion, added drunkenness to thirst, and with as sturdy, though sorry justification of themselves in their great unworthiness (in an answer returned me unto my letter) mingled several other scurrilous, spurious and base-born imputations, hoping (as it should seem) to stop my mouth with such dirt and mire. Hereupon, judging my self so far a debtor both to the truth &amp; my own repute on the one hand, and to the interest of the peace of their consciences, on the other, as to endeavour the vindication of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the promotion of the latter; I was constrained to Print and publish both the said letters, together with some animadversions upon them in order unto both. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men themselves (it seems) had no mind after the publishing of their letters, with my notes upon them, to wade any further into the waters of this contest: but bemoaning their case to a friend of theirs in black, prevailed with him to espouse their quarrel, who judging his arm of learning to be longer and stronger then theirs, clothed it with a pamphlet, and to stretched it forth in their defence against me. I thought it not convenient to let this <hi>Anonymus</hi> pass without some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, lest he should be wise in his own conceit, and be a snare to his Clients, in occasioning or tempting them by a colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and false plea, to think themselves innocent. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense of time bestowed upon this Beacon-firing incounter, cast me yet further behind hand with my <hi>trium-viri,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to stick so much the longer in the birth. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That which obstructed my progress in the work <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> more then all these was the importune spirit of <hi>Anabaptism,</hi> which, by the just and wise permission of God, having first taken a female head near relating to a member of that Church-body which relateth unto me as my peculiar care and charge, soon after from thence by the mediation of the opportunity, conveyed it self into the head that lay next to it; and having better fortified it self here, it attempted the
<pb facs="tcp:65873:4"/> enlargment of its quarters upon those that were not like to make much resistance; and so prospered and prevailed in its way as a canker is wont to do, when it frets, and spreads, and preys further and further upon the body or flesh which it hath once seized. And being a spirit of Division, it was not satisfied with separating and dividing one part of this body from the other by water onely (over which there had been opportunity enough for spiritual commerce, and Church Communion) but magnified it self further to divide them by fire also, inflaming its own proselytes with such a fiery zeal over their new way by water, that they judged themselves more worthy and primitively holy by means thereof, then to incorporate or correspond in Church-Communion with any person, who goeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et wandring after it: how ful of Faith and of the Holy Ghost soever, Master <hi>Kendal</hi> in one of his books take notice of this breach upon the people under my hand, and seems to rejoyce a great rejoycing, that such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparagement (for so he notions it) had befallen me. But for any man to triumph when <hi>Sathan</hi> conquers, is of no good a bode, or signification. However, the Spirit I speak of, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his part in that body, which now he possessed, much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner with that foul spirit in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

By this troublesome spirit I was drawn to a double contest. First, I was ingaged to stop the mouth of that plea, wherein he pleaded the unlawfulness of conjunction between believers dipt, and believers undipt, in Church-society, and that there was no firm footing, but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-dipping, for Church-communion. Secondly, Unless I would give way to him, and suffer him quietly to carry away the truth from my dear people, I was necessitated likewise, with the drawn sword of the Spirit to oppose him in his way, wherein he was attempting to circumvent poor children of
<pb facs="tcp:65873:4"/> that Baptismal Patrimony which their Heavenly Father hath setled on them, and which their first feoffees in trust (the Primitive Christians) did constantly and conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously exhibit unto them. This double encounter entrencht very deep upon my time, and had cast my thoughts about my <hi>trium-viri</hi> (well nigh into a dead sleep.) But after a while I recovered from under this indisposition also, and stood to my work again. I had not been at it long, when</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I considering how enormous and insupportable, <label type="milestone">

The testimony which I drew up in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Gentlemen Triers were (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less) in the choice of their Proctor, over-ruled by him, whose affairs they so frequently over-rule contrarie to his mind and Interest. Otherwise they would not have sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a person of that infamous and unclean character for their service. When <hi>Israel,</hi> contrarie to the mind of God, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a King, he gave them a King, but in his anger, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.11. In like manner, the Triers desiring an Advocate to plead such a cause, which God abhorreth, he assigns them an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate in his displeasure; a man that curseth whatsoever he blesseth, and blesseth whatsoever he curseth; a man that will render them, <hi>corpus cum causa,</hi> both in person, and cause, an abhorring and hissing unto the nation for ever. And if any of them have mingled a proportion of their subtile brains with the forlorn Conscience of the Author of that book (for the book hath a double image visibly stampt upon it, like our <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> coyn, and there is aN EY of <hi>Oxford</hi>-learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aswel as a mouth of <hi>Oxford</hi> railing in the composition) <hi>oleum &amp; operam perdiderunt,</hi> they have done weakly herein, and lost their labour. For probabilities and faces of truth are little regarded when they are found amongst such swarms and heaps of notorious falshoods and untruths. Onely, were I a person considerable enough to make an object capable of an affront, they have taken an ingenious and learned course to disparage me home; <hi>viz.</hi> By turning my Book over to the Common Pamphleter for an answer; which is hardly one degree in favour removed from procuring an edict from Authority, to have had it burnt by the Common Hang-man. And had this bin the doom of it, I had not bin surprized, nor taken without my <hi>Christian</hi> armour of proof upon me to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me from taking harm by the brunt or incounter. I have through the great bounty of my God towards me, more in my hand, then a book or a little credit with men, to lay
<pb facs="tcp:65873:5"/> down at the feet of Jesus Christ my Lord, when he shall please to call. But for Mr. <hi>Nedham,</hi> the work of advocating the Triers cause, fell into his hands very happily, nor would it have sorted so well with the condition of any person I know as it did with his. For when a man knows not what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to do with his time, nor how to spend that without spending his livelyhood and subsistence with it, the washing of blackemoores, and glewing of Oystershells, are conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and saving imployments for him. But this (I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) is somewhat digressive also.</p>
            <p>But the testimony of God, &amp; of the word of Jesus against the Triers, administred by my hand, occasioned it seemes such an overflowing of the gall in the men, that no less then a double revenge upon me put in execution, was sufficient to perfect the cure, or heal them. For it was but an half cure (as it appears) of the malady, that they delivered me over to this Tormentor to be scourged by him: they themselves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this turned Informers against me, and accused me (for what crime, or misdemeanour I know not to this hour) to the secular powers. The articles of my accusation were onely certain innocent passages (so adjudged by all that had viewed and perused them, as far as I can understand, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves haply excepted) transcribed out of my book; against any of which notwithstanding they had not a word to say, or to object, whilest I was present. Onely they had (as it seemes) privately and underhand prepossest some that were to be my Judges, with an opinion, that one, or more, of the said passages, were reflexive upon their Authority. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is sufficiently known to the world, that I have alwayes been as faithful, as zealous an Assertor and vindicator of their Authority, I will not say as any of the <hi>Triers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (for none of them have been much tainted with this honourable guilt, as far as I know) but as any other of their best Friends whosoever: nor have I to this hour suffered the least alteration or change, either in my judgement, or my affections, that way. Onely I have so far comported with the light of reason and conscience within me, as to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<pb facs="tcp:65873:6"/> between the Authority, and the wills of Persons in power: yea and to look upon these in many of their actings, as the greatest enemies to the other; and according to the Commission I have received from <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to seek the peace and welfare of all men by declaring the truth, to handle them accordingly. But my Friends and Enemies, the <hi>Triers,</hi> by the advantage of the surplussage of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest above mine, in my Judges, and of the daily opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of access to their ear, whereof I am as good as wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, without proof or eviction of any miscarriage or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness in me, they obtained of them this salvage of their Honour, and gratification of their wills, to be admitted to stand by and hear with what severity I should be reproved for their sakes. I will by no means say it, but onely put it to consideration, whether the proceedings against me in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Triers,</hi> do not (in part, at least) resemble those, wherein it was acknowledged by the Judge, that upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination he found no fault in the man accused, and yet prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered this to satisfie the accusers (though it was not accepted, wherein I confess a dissimilitude.) <hi>I will therefore chastise him, and so let him go.</hi>

The light was kept from it for several months upon this account also, besides the time ordinarily required to the forming of such births in this womb. Yet at last (as thou

What the entertainment of it is like to be with the generality of the world, is of ready conjecture: however, this concerneth the world it self more then me. And yet, though I be as secure from suffering in any Interest of mine own, by the coursest and ruggedest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment that can be given it, as I am regardless of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that might accrue unto me by a fairer acceptance; yet out of my unfeigned love to all those in the world that are partakers of flesh and blood with me, and desire of their welfare and peace, I wish them from my heart communion and fellowship with me in the light of those great Truths, that are occasionally (and so, briefly) argued in these papers. For I know them by those express characters of Spirit and life, that are so visible in them, to be the Truths of God: nor have I met with any thing in the writings of any, or of all the three men of my present contest, which hath in the least shaken my confidence in this kind, or that for the least space of time put me to any stond, or loss in my understanding concerning them, or to seek what to answer to any thing they offer or object against any of them. I confess that the drawing up of several of my answers, and the setting down of my sense and notion in many of them, in terms, phrases, and carriage of sentences, most commodious (as I conceived) for the understandings of others, have cost me both time and labour not inconsiderable. But their exceptions and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salls to the grounds and reasons, whether from Scripture, or from received principles in Christian Religion, on which the Tenents or Doctrines avouched in this Treatise, are built, are so inconsiderable, trivial, and slight, that they make lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle work for the understandings of men competently versed in the controversies, to dissolve and scatter them.</p>
            <p>The chief artifices and Methods, by which the Patrons of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> the Contra-remonstant Election, Reprobation, Efficacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Grace, Perseverance, &amp;c. are wont to divide between the judgements and consciences of men, and the truth in the
<pb facs="tcp:65873:7"/> contrary opinions, are</p>
            <p>First, as we read that some Persecutours did by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the primitive times, when they put them into beasts skins, and then set mastives upon them to worry and destroy them; so do these men cover the native and Divine beauty of the said Doctrines with the odious epithets and aspersions of <hi>Arminian, Pelagian, Semi-Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian, Socinian, Pontifician▪</hi> &amp;c. and then exasperate and incite the judgements and consciences of illiterate, weak, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant men and women against them, as if they were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangerous bloody malefactours, and that there was no way with their souls but one, in case they suffer them to come any whit nearer them, then by the distance of an utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation. And yet in some of my writings (although the place at present occurreth not) I have made it fully evident from the express testimony of <hi>Austine</hi> himself (and as I take it, from other writers also) that their Doctrine concerning limited Redemption by <hi>Christ</hi> (and consequently the rest depending hereon) was the express Doctrine of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> And as concerning the scandal of <hi>Arminian, Socinian, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifician,</hi> it is importune and sensless to brand or burthen, such and such Tenents or Doctrines, as we please, with the Names of such or such particular Authors, upon pretence they were held by them contrary to the truth, when as we our selves hold and maintain twenty and ten opinions held by the same men, &amp; this with as much contrariety to the Truth, for ought that hitherto hath been proved, and yet will not endure these to pass under the same disgraceful denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But the greater vote (it seemes) must still carry it: and Truth be content to wait for a fair and equitable hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, untill she hath opened as many mouthes to plead for her, as her Enemy (Errour) hath, or shall have, to declaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her.

               </gap> less then tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, that his Doctrine of perseverance is owned and asserted by the two Great Popish Doctors, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Suares.</hi> May not I then, or any other man, upon as reasonable an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, stigmatize such a Doctrine, with the ignominious
<pb facs="tcp:65873:7"/> character of Popish, or <hi>Jesuitical,</hi> as either Master <hi>Kendal,</hi> or the said Doctor, or any other partisan of theirs, cast the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of <hi>Arminian,</hi> much more of <hi>Pelagian,</hi> upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents argued for by me in these controversies? Yea the truth is, that such a Doctrine of Perseverance, as the said Doctor abetteth, would make a more connatural and suitable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the crazie body of Popish Divinity, then in the body of the Doctrine maintained by Protestants, and those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess a Reformed Religion. And as for the scandal and asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of <hi>Pelagian,</hi> thrown at peradventure, and <hi>de bene esse,</hi> by the Doctor, upon the Opinions held forth and pleaded for in my book of Redemption, I am afraid that either he doth not understand what the Doctrines of <hi>Pelagius</hi> were, or that he is not willing to understand what mine are. For I am groundedly assured, that there is not any one of those opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which were charged upon <hi>Pelagius</hi> as erroneous by the Fathers, judged Orthodox in his time, which is defended or owned by me, either in that book, or any other of my writings; In which respect I know not how the Doctor with all his learning and wit will escape the arrest of that most true observation of <hi>Austin</hi> long since; Some persons of understanding will sooner quarrel at that which they do not understand, then seek to understand it, and so render themselves proud calumniators, instead of modest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Non nulli intelligentes citius volunt exagitare quod non intelligunt, quam quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ut intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant: &amp; non fiunt humiles inquisitores, sed superbi calumni atores. <hi>Aug.

            <p>A second device or stratagem, which our Great Masters of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> the <hi>Contra-remonstrancie</hi> make much use of to enlarge their quarters, and make proselytes to their cause, is to affright vulgar and less considerate spirits with the hideous &amp; dismal consequences attending (as they pretend) the opinions of their adversaries; As (for instance) that they are injurious to free Grace, that they are exaltative of the creature, that they deny the Soveraignty of God over his creature, that they make men their own Saviours, that they suppose that <hi>Christ</hi> might have died, and yet no man have been saved, that <hi>Christ</hi> might have been an Head without a Body, that the damned in hell owe as much unto God as those that are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb facs="tcp:65873:8"/> with some others of like impertinencie with these. For some of these are no true or real consequents of the opinions charged with them, but onely imaginary and obtruded. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them, are indeed the true and lawful consequents of the said opinions, but in a sense which renders them innocent and harmless, and wherein they are no absurdities at all; not in such a sense, wherein the <hi>Contra-Remonstrant</hi> intendeth they should, and hopeth they will, be understood by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary sort of Professours. A third sort of them, are in the plainest and nearest-hand sense of the words, consequents (indeed) of the said opinions; but they are sayings of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berness and truth, and no touch of unworthiness or falshood in them. Of the former kind are these, that the said Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant opinions are injurious to free Grace, exalt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature above her line, deny or limit the just prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of God, &amp;c. These (with some others of like kind) are most importunely and with notorious injury and untruth charged upon them. These clearly give unto Grace the things which belong unto Grace; and unto nature or the Creature man, the things which belong unto them, and no more, going along with Scripture award in both: They are the contrary opinions that are expresly delinquent in both these. Of the second sort, are these (with their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) that they (the said opinions, nick-named <hi>Arminian</hi>) make men their own Saviours, that the damned in hell owe as much unto God as those that are saved, <hi>Judas</hi> as much as <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. That there is a sense wherein men may (and this without errour, and without derogation in the least from the great Saviour of the world) be termed their own Saviours, or (which is the same) to save themselves, is evident enough from the Scriptures.— <hi>For in doing this</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy) thou shalt save thy self and them that heare thee</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.) And by the same rule, they who heard <hi>Timothy,</hi> and mingled the word they heard from him with Faith, might be said also to <hi>save</hi> themselves. So when <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted his new Converts, <hi>Save your selves from this froward generation, (Act.</hi> 2.40.) his meaning (doubtless) was, that by keeping
<pb facs="tcp:65873:8"/> themselves faom being ensnared in the counsels or wayes of the generation he speaks of, they might, or should save their own souls. And it is a most true and useful observation of <hi>Chamier</hi> concerning Scripture dialect in such cases, as that we now speak of; That <hi>when there is a concurrence of several causes required to the production of the same effect, the Scripture is wont to ascribe this effect, one while to one of these causes, and another while to another.</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Solet Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, cum ad unum effectum multae cansae concurrunt, modò uni, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dò alteri, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum tribuere. <hi>Panstrat. t. 4. l. 22. c. 4. Sect. 39. p. 935.</hi>
               </note> So that in the sense explained, to make men their own Saviours, hath no inconvenience or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the least, but carrieth a most wholesome and savoury notion and sense in it. But the <hi>Contra-Remonstrant</hi> Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when he chargeth his adversaries, that by their opinions they make men their own Saviours, would be understood that they make them their own Saviours, either in a way of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or by some such self-efficiency, in respect whereof the great effect of their salvation, should principally, or in some high or super-transcendent way, be ascribed unto themselves; which is a conceit asmuch abhorred by them, as by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And concerning the respective debts of the damned, and of the saved, unto God, and in what sense it is true (and so a consequent of the opinions by-named <hi>Arminian</hi>) that the former owe as much as the latter, and in what sense or respects it is false (and so holding no communion with the said opinions) is clearly argued and stated in the fifthteenth chapter of the ensuing discourse, pag. 188, 189 &amp;c. where the Reader may satisfie himself touching the impertinencie of this charge upon the said opinions.</p>
            <p>Of the third and last sort of consequents, wherewith the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> enemies of these opinions hope to create envy and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency in the minds of men against them, are these (possibly with some others) That men may be saved, if they will.

And in case men were really, unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and throughly willing to be saved, what in reason can be imagined should hinder their salvation? Certainly God, who by all kinds of Evangelical applications unto men, seeks to make them willing in this kind, will not put this will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, or send it empty away, when he hath raised it. And if God <hi>will have all men to be saved</hi> (as the Apostle avoucheth his will in this kind,)<note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.4.</note> and men themselves likewise shall be willing accordingly, who, or what can be supposed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene to hinder the effect, or to withstand their salvation? I have elsewhere drawn together many sayings of men as fast friends (at least so reputed) to the Decisions of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> as either Master <hi>Kendal,</hi> or Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> and some of them (a Deanerie excepted) no wayes their inferiors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they plainely resolve the condemnation or perishing of men into their own wills.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:65873:9"/> as the far greater part of men now doth. And <hi>Elihu's</hi> reasoning with <hi>Job</hi> is considerable to this point: <hi>If thou be righteous, what givest thou unto him</hi> [meaning, God] <hi>or what receiveth he of thine hand?</hi>
               <note n="(h)" place="margin">Job. 35.7.</note> Immediately before he had said: <hi>If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him?</hi> or <hi>if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</hi> So that God is neither a gainer by any mans believing, or by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing saved upon it; nor yet a loser by any mans unbelief, or his perishing upon it. His act of Grace and love unto the world in the gift of his Son <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to die for the sins and salvation of it, had been the same, and so equally contentful and satisfactory unto him, whether the world, or any the members hereof, had believed in him, or been saved by him, or no. And (to speak the truth) it is a very weak conceit to imagine that the contentment or welfare of the Divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any the least part or degree thereof, is dependent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the worthy actings of men, or upon that reward of theirs which he hath promised thereunto. Nor is it a notion of much more affinitie, either with reason, or religion, to think that God could not have told how to make earnings of the gift and death of <hi>Christ,</hi> unless some men, or (to speak to the sense of our adversaries) unless such, or such a number of men, had believed in him, and been saved by him. Now whatever may reasonably be conceived not to be, or not to have been, essentially requisite to the glory of God, there is no repugnancie in reason to suppose a possibility of the non-being, or never-being, of it. For there is nothing that makes any thing simply and absolutely necessary, but an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential, or absolutely-necessary connexion thereof with the glory of the first being. It is true, when God intended the gift &amp; death of his Son Jesus Christ for the world he knew that in time many would believe on him, and so be saved by him: but this at no h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd proves that therefore the death of Christ for the world, or for men simply considered, or as intended by God, implies an utter or absolute impossibility, but that some or other should believe in him, and be saved by him.

            <p>A third method much practised by the <hi>Contra-Remonstrant</hi> party, in their warfare against better opinions then their own, is to pervert both the words and the sense of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, and one while to report and argue their opinions, and sayings, in words materially differing from their own; otherwhile, to argue against such a sense put upon their words, which they cannot lightly but know to be far from that intended by them. Take a <hi>Contra-Remonstrant</hi> without one, or both, of these knacks, and his Motto may be</p>

            <p>Instances in both these kinds more then a few, are of ready observation in both Master <hi>Kendals</hi> Books. He that shall please to acquaint himself with the contents of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse, shall see visions of this character great plenty. In his Latine epistle to his fair nursing Mother (the University of <hi>Oxford</hi>) neither his credit,<note place="margin">Ad Almam ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem Academiā Oxoniensem.</note> nor conscience, would restrain him from fathering this base begotten changeling of his own, upon his Adversaries; viz. <hi>that those dumb Orators, the Sun, Moon, &amp; Stars, do with little less obscurity declare all the most
<pb facs="tcp:65873:10"/> hidden mysteries of Faith, then those speciall messengers of whose writings the Church of Christ maketh such treasure</hi> (meaning, the Prophets, Apostles and Evangelists) If the man had had either so little wit, or so much honestie, as to have cited the words of any of his adversaries, wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their sense or judgment concerning the Doctrine preach'd by the <hi>dumb Orators</hi> he speaks of unto the world (although the Scripture doth not make them so <hi>dumb,</hi> but that they do both <hi>enarrare,</hi> and <hi>indicare,</hi> declare or speak out, the glory of God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.1.) <hi>Quasi sorex suo indicio pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riret;</hi> such his citation would have made him appear a man of a profligate conscience, in charging worthy men, and who never did or meant him the least harm, with such importune and sensless notions and conceits, and which he had not the least cause given him to think that ever they came into their thoughts. There is none of them (I am securely confident) ever held, or taught, that the <hi>Sun, Moon and Stars taught all (no, not so much as any one of) the most hidden mysteries of Faith with little less obscurity then the Prophets, Apostles, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists.</hi> This is nothing but a broad Unchristian scandal, and calumnie thrown upon them. For my self, upon whom the Gentleman (I know) particularly glanceth in that his repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation and charge, I never either thought, or said, that the teaching of the Sun, Moon and Stars, and this in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction too with the continuance of other providential and gracious administrations of God, extended any further then onely to inform the world in general, that God is by one means or other pacified about the sinfull provocations of men; and that from hence it follows, that this means in reason must be such, which is sufficient and proper to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or satisfie an infinite justice, as the justice of God, even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inciples of sound reason, must needs be. Is this to declare <hi>all the most hidden mysteries of Faith?</hi> or (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) any one of the <hi>most hidden mysteries</hi> hereof? Or is that which may be known by the light of nature, or of reason, onely working upon, and consulting with, the frame or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the world, as yet supported and kept on foot, and
<pb facs="tcp:65873:11"/> graciously administred by God, any of the <hi>most hidden my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Faith,</hi> yea or any <hi>mystery of Faith</hi> at all? But Master <hi>Kendal</hi> stumbles at this stone, and hurts his conscience, ten times over; and his partie, (more generally) praiseth this his saying, by their walking in the same way of folly with him. And as he takes a lawless liberty to report the opinions of his Adversaries in words and terms of his own of a quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing import from those, wherein they themselves deliver them; so doth he as customarily, and this by a spirit of a voluntary &amp; known mistake, chase away the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his adversaries out of their words, and instead here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, investing them with a sense of his own (you may well think, absurd, and obnoxious enough) he falls stoutly on, and argues <hi>in oppositum.</hi> Thus when he comes to confute my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the will, or Intentions of God, into <hi>Antecedent</hi> and <hi>Subsequent</hi> (though the Distinction be as well owned by some of the Grandees of his own side, as by me, as I shew in due place) he meddles not at all with my sense in those terms, <hi>Antecedent</hi> and <hi>Consequent</hi> (though it cannot reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be thought but that he knew it clearly enough, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so distinctly and perspicuously expressed it) but vesteth in them a weak and fond sense of his own, and which I had expresly and <hi>in terminis</hi> disowned and declared against, and then with his learned valour advanceth close up unto it, and tightly bastinado's it with his pen. The story of this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantrie is drawn up at large in the twentieth chapter of the Discourse now in thy hand: But this is not the unhallowed policie of Master <hi>Kendal</hi> alone; the Souldierie of the same Campania with him are generally sick of the same disease. Doctor <hi>John Owen</hi> will needs have me to hold, whether I, or my words, will or no, that Perseverance is to be obtained by <hi>manly considerations,</hi> and by the excercise and improvement of a mans own abilities, without any concurrence or assistance of the Grace of God. This unhallowed morsel is so above measure sweet and pleasant to his tast, that he chews and champs it over and over; as if he knew not how to make merrie with his undertaking, without the solace and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
<pb facs="tcp:65873:11"/> of it. And by the authority of this usurping supposition, he stigmatizeth my Doctrine of Perseverance with this brand of infamy, (at least as he weeneth it) that <hi>my maintaining of the Saints perseverance, is as bad, if not worse, then my maintaining their Apostasy.</hi> I confess that my maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saints perseverance is as bad, but not worse, then my maintaining their apostasie: but in such a sense, as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors maintaining justification by Faith, is as bad, but not worse then his maintaining condemnation thorow unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. When two things are precisesly, and as things considered, equal or alike in goodness, they must needs be so in evil or badness also. But ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tainly the Doctors ingenuity and conscience were both withdrawn, when his Enemie and mine tempted him to make so sad a breach upon his honour, as to charge me with either holding, or saying, that the Saints may persevere by any means whatsoever without the Grace of God; my constant and avowed sense and Doctrine being, that <hi>what good thing soever any man doth, he doth it through the assistance of the Free-Grace of God, and is in no capacity or meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness so much as to conceive or think a good thought without it.</hi> These are my words published to the world in a smal piece, intituled <hi>The Remedy of unreasonableness (pag.</hi> 7) where the Doctor, or who please, may with the expense (I believe) of less then the fourth part of a quarter of an hour, view the compass of my judgment touching the Grace of God, aswel in the Freeness and fulness, as effectualness of it. And if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor can produce any sentence of mine, either concerning Perseverance, or any other subject, contrary to the tenour and import of the words now recited, I shall provide him a lodging of much more honour in my thoughts, then yet I am able to do. But if he cannot, how shall I be perswaded to think that he hath so much as one hair of a man of ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon his head?

Popish writers I find charged by Protestant Divines w<seg rend="sup">th</seg> this Sophistry. Their manner (it seems) is, when the point precisely in issue between them &amp; their adversaries, is on their adversaries side, a truth so conditioned, that it wil hardly admit of a coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or plausible argument in direct opposition to it, and on their side, so ill qualified an Errour, that labouring in the very fire will hardly set so much as a good face upon it; the
<pb facs="tcp:65873:12"/> Popish guise (I say) in this case is, by <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> his art, and sleight of hand, to foist into the dispute a by-question, which shall be more feasable, and bear arguments better then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and so to hunt counter, and follow a false sent with an open mouth, and loud cry, whilest an unwarie Reader shall all this while think that they are in pursuit of their lawful game. The Contra-Remonstrant Protestant hath (it seems) learned policie of his Pontifician-Adversarie. For when they are pinched, and il-apai'd with the true state of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion between them, and those that hold up the bucklers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them in the <hi>Dort</hi> cause, so that they perceive they are not like to make earnings in bearing up close with that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they pretend to incounter, their arrows still falling, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther short, or over, or wide on the one hand or the other, they secretly and with as little noise or liableness to obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as may be, bring up upon the stage a false question, much in the habit and likeness of the true: and having so much wisdom as to chuse the right side of this false question for themselves, leaving the wrong side for their adversaries (who notwithstanding will not own it) they drive on mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and do execution all along the pursuite; the in-obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Reader all this while admiring the strength of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and imagining that they see, as in a vision of the noon day, their adversaries falling before them to the ground. Master <hi>Kendal</hi> knows the way to this Sanctuary, as well as any man: and hath so oft repaired to it, that he hath made a bare and beaten path to it, easie for any man to find after him. For brevity sake, I shall not here insist upon instances, especially considering that I have drawn many of these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the 20. chapter of the Discourse it self: &amp; an attentive Reader may find more in the writings of other men of the same perswasions.</p>
            <p>A fifth artifice, which they who have espoused the unjust <label type="milestone">

<pb facs="tcp:65873:13"/> to back their cause with the authority and names of men of note and worth in the Reformed Churches; who otherwise would either stand for cyphers in these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, or else be found standing by the Remonstants, countenancing and strengthning them in their cause. For when the writings of <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elancthon, Musculus, Bucer, Pareus, Gualter</hi> (which others of like cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and repute) are withal pregnancie, clearness and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressness of sentence, cited by the Remonstrants in favour of them and their cause (as frequently they are in their polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal discourses) it is the constant manner and practise of their adversaries to make these or such like answers to them; that such passages and sayings are to be construed and understood by such and such others out of the same mens writings, being of a contrary tenour and import. Now what is this but to reduce light unto darkness, on the one hand, and to mediate reconciliation between plain and palpable contradictions on the other? The disingenuous and importune, the unclerklike, yea unmanlike, the uncouth and exotick interpretations, glosses, senses and constructions, that by men of the <hi>Dort</hi> Faith are put upon many sayings produced by the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians (so called) from the writings of the mentioned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, are enough to mediate an utter dislike both of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and practises with all ingenuous and impartial men. If Master <hi>Kendal</hi> would be but either so ingenuous, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous (let him chuse whither) as to interpret my words and sayings by the same rules, either of sense or non-sense (let him chuse whether) by which he interprets the words and sayings of <hi>Calvin, Musculus</hi> (with many other Authors both ancient and modern) alledged from their undoubted writings by me, to prove their consent in judgment (at least when they wrote such things) with me about the points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted in my book of Redemption, I should stand, either as fairly, or as fouly (let him chuse whether) absolved and discharged (by him) from the crime of <hi>Arminianism,</hi> as they. Towards the close of his former book, having told me that <hi>I have not produced any testimony either from ancient, or latter Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
<pb facs="tcp:65873:13"/> but such, which he and his are ready to subscribe,</hi> viz. <hi>That Christ died for all sorts of men</hi> (I believe I produce no testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from either of this import) <hi>yea and for all particular men,</hi> &amp;c. He subjoyns, <hi>the Question is not about the truth, but the sense of these words, Christ died for all: and when you shall shew us where the Fathers say, he intended as much, effected as much, for them that perish, as for those that are saved, so that they in Heaven have just as much cause to bless God, as those in hell, then will we take time to consider it,</hi> &amp;c. But if Master <hi>Kendal</hi> judged no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Fathers declaring their sense in these precise words, a reasonable ground for him so much <hi>as to take time to consider</hi> [whether they were of my sense about the Doctrine of Redemption, or no] why did he not upon the same ground take as much <hi>time to consider,</hi> whether I be of any such opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about the same subject, as he layeth to my charge? For certain I am that he never met with those words from my, either lips, or pen, which (it seems) he must of necessity find in the writings of the Fathers, to inable him to so high an undertaking, as to <hi>take time to consider</hi> whether they were of my judgment or no. If any learned and sober man were in a capacity (though never so remote) of being put out of love with learning, the reading of Master <hi>Kendals</hi> seventh chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his latter book, with a serious consideration of his sad behaviour all along (well nigh) in the carriage of it, were enough to actuate such his capacity, and to move him to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure all communion with books, or learning, for ever. His undertaking in this chapter is to answer the testimonies and authorities urged by me from the writings as well of the Ancient Fathers, as of many late Reformed Divines, to prove, that the Fathers generally, and others, by happy fits (at least) and surprisals with the truth, were of the same notion and sense with me about the perseverance of the Saints. If the Authors themselves were alive, and should read, or come to understand what work M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yea and should they not have (in Master <hi>Kendals</hi> own dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) <hi>a considerable share in that dull vertue of patience,</hi> they would hardly refrain, could they get neer him, the smiting him on the face, for putting such indignities upon them, by wresting and perverting their right and streight words, to a crooked and mishapen sense of his own.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Kendal</hi> in this chapter shews himself an <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one of a thousand,</hi> but not for dexterity, but for wayward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and left-handedness in interpreting; as if he had been bred and brought up at the feet of some wilful &amp; desperately-resolved Jew, by whose froward and importune puttings off of such pregnant texts, which out of his own Scriptures are brought and argued against him, to prove <hi>Christ</hi> the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> he had learned the Brazen faculty of making <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> and of ejecting the native and proper sense out of mens words, to invest them with an exotick meaning of his own. Instance might be given in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars not a few: but they that delight to see disingenuity in her exaltation, may at their leisure repair to the chapter it self. But neither is he alone in this dishonourable way of shifting: the greatest part of those that accompany him in his judgement, and appear with him in writing for it, have a smatch of the same learning. His compeer Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> doth little less then justifie him in this his unscholarlike pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of misusing Authors, by dishonouring himself with the guilt of the same unworthiness. Yet may other Authors the more patiently bear unhandsome usage from these men, because they stick not to offer the same course measure to the Prophets and Apostles, yea and to the Lord Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if their words or sayings stand in their way, as ever and anon they do. A tast whereof I shall exhibit to the Reader
<pb facs="tcp:65873:14"/> in the sequel of this epistle. But at one turn in the way we are now upon, Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> shews better steel in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, then Master <hi>Kendal:</hi> The latter doth not say that his adversaries claime antiquity without proof, whereas the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer saith that his adversaries <hi>claime it theirs,</hi> not onely <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof,</hi> but <hi>without shame</hi> too. I confess one of his adversaries claimes it <hi>without shame,</hi> as knowing that no <hi>shame</hi> belongs to such a <hi>claime.</hi> But for him to say that he <hi>claimes</hi> it <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof,</hi> is a most shameful, or shameless (which he please) saying. For besides several testimonies speaking very signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly to the Doctrine asserted by me, cited from <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Nazienzen, Origen,</hi> and especially from <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> (p. 370, 371, 372, 373, 374. of my book of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) who all wrote before <hi>Pelagius</hi> spake, have I not reported the sense and judgment of antiquity concerning the point of Perseverace, from <hi>John Gerardus Vossius,</hi> (a more diligent and skilful surveyor of antiquity, and I believe a more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Relator of what is to be seen or found here, then Doctot <hi>John Owen</hi>) In which report transcribed from the author, the sense of antiquity, and this demonstratively confirmed by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies in abundance (and those pregnant and pertinent to his purpose) from the best writers of these times, touching the Doctrine debated between the Doctor and me, is more accurately, and with such distinctions layd down, that by them all the quotations levied by the Doctor in favour of his notion, are discovered to be impertinencies, or at most to speak but brokenly and faintly to his mind.</p>

They attempt to interess God in their quarrel, and make him a party with them in their cause, and themselves onely his advocates and friends. Yea, and with great heat of zeal and heighth of confidence bear the world in hand, that those that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary-minded to them, are enemies to the Grace of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious unto his Prerogative and Soveraignty over his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, over-bold in prying into the Secrets of God, Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Counsels, depravers of his word, &amp;c. Whereas
<pb facs="tcp:65873:15"/> they stand by him in all these his concerments with all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and he by them, approving, countenancing, and commending them for their good service to him in this kind, as if the Great God of Heaven, and all his glory, were embarqued in the same bottome with them. With such insinuations and pretences as these, they gain credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to their Doctrine with unballassed and light judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and with persons, <hi>qui malunt credere quam judicare,</hi> who had rather buy their Tenents with credulity, because this is cheap, then with exactness of judgment, this being costly, tempting them upon all occasions, to believe, that when their Adversaries oppose them, and their (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so unreasonable and importune) notions and sayings, they do no less then rise up against God, and against his word. The Reader may observe strains of this device more then a few in the respective volumes of Master <hi>George Kendal,</hi> and Doctor <hi>John Owen,</hi> about the perseverance of the Saints, especially in their epistles and prefixes before the said books.

When they have first thus humbled and abased it, and laid it low in the apprehensions of their Readers, any slight or slubbering Answer will do execution enough upon it. The way of this retreat is sufficiently known unto, and occupied by Master <hi>Kendal:</hi> but, it is worn bare and threed-bare with the feet of Doctor <hi>John Owen.</hi> He seldom ingageth against any argument, whether levied from some text of Scripture, or from the clearest principles of reason, but first he vilifieth and disgraceth it: and when he hath made it sofr and tender by steeping it thorowly in this liquor, an answer made of a straw will serve to thrust it thorow, and lay it for dead. The very transcription of such expressions and passages of this character and import out of his book would (I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) amount to a competent volume. And as far as I have been able to observe and judge by that cursorie reading of his book, which my leisure and occasions otherwise have afforded me, the greater weight or force he apprehends in any argument with which he is to grapple, the higher he lifts up his pen to smite it with disparagement and scorn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

If bables will keep froward children quiet, it is pity (I say) but they should have them. For the truth is, that I do not know any occasion in the least given him by me in my book of Redemption, in any part of it; why he should complain of me to <hi>the Right worshipful his worthy Friends and brethren, that many of my Polemical Treatises have been sprinkled with satyrical sarcasms.</hi> I am not consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to my self of any one expression, or passage, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end of that <hi>Treatise,</hi> that will excuse him from the guilt of a false accuser, that shall call it a <hi>satyrical sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casme.</hi> Yea the man after his own heart, to whom he hath given a testimony that would indifferently serve his own worth, parts and learning (Master <hi>Kendal</hi> I mean) he I say hath given testimony of the <hi>sobriety</hi> found <hi>in the whole car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> of that book. And yet this treatise (I believe) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts in bulk and content, to the one half of all my <hi>pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi> writings. And if his Doctorship were put upon it, or would please freely of himself, to declare, how many of my <hi>polemical</hi> Treatises would make his <hi>many,</hi> I believe his <hi>many</hi> would be found too few to salve the honor and sacred esteem of <hi>verbum Sacerdotis.</hi> I confess my pen is somewhat (possibly, too much: but if so, my good God pardon me) acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb facs="tcp:65873:16"/> inclined against unreasonable and importune men, who arming their ignorance with a brest-plate of confidence, will needs be troubling the world with it, especially those who fight against <hi>the powers of the world to come;</hi> opposing and obstructing those great Truths of the Gospel in their course, which did they run and were glorified, would soon turn the captivity of the world under sin and sorrow, <hi>as the streams in the South.</hi> So likewise when I have to do with that generation of men, in whom I find the spirit of the old Scribes and Pharisees working, it is like I may follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> together with the examples of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, and the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> himself, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, rebuking them somewhat sharply. But let my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est enemy winnow and sift all my <hi>Polemical Treatises</hi> from the first to the last, until all the dross and soil of <hi>satyrical sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casmes</hi> be gotten out of them, and put together, (yea, let Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Kendal</hi> himself be the man chosen for this imployment, because he is as like as any man I know, to find faults which are not) I believe they would not all make a greater heap of sinful infirmities, either greater in bulk, or greater in deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then the imperious, lofty, and supercilious strains, the disingenuous, uncivil, un-priest-like, un-clerk-like, un-scholar-like entreaties of his adversary (by whom he was not provoked in the least further then what a modest and sober speaking the truth might provoke him) together with the notorious depravations, corruptions, falsifications of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and sense of him against whom he pretends to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, which might readily be collected out of this one book of the Doctors, concerning Perseverance. But his prolepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call insultations, and avilements of arguments before hand, compared with the impertinency of his answers (as far as yet I am capable of them) are documental unto me of this, that the Greatest crowers are not alwayes the best cocks of the game. For (I speak the truth with all ingenuity, and clearness of spirit) many of his strains in arguing, many of his grounds and principles in answering, are as uncouth and exotick to my understanding, as if his intellectualls and
<pb facs="tcp:65873:17"/> mine had not been cast in the same mold, nor he and I made creatures of the same kind. His self-conceited demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are not so much as dialectical or topicall proofs to me: and for many of his fundamentals in the fabrick of his Disputation for his notion of Perseverance, my soul know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how to take pleasure in them. Yea when he doth not strictly argue, but onely declare, or speak Orator-like, as in his epistles prefixed to his book, his sense and notion oft-times is so retired and abstruse, that reading some periods twice or thrice over, with the closest intention I could, and with a very great desire to communicate with him in his thought, yet I suffered disappointment, and was not able to reach him. At some turns I thought his Printer might be accessary to my sufferings in this kind: but at others I could observe no symptome of such a cause.</p>

            <p>So that whereas I was one while under deliberation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God judging it meet to spare me health, life, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I should rather serve the truth by drawing up some brief reply to the Adversaries thereof, respectively, who should take the open field against it, or by pursuing my intentions in completing my Book, intituled <hi>Redemption Redeemed,</hi> by adding a second part unto it, according to the method or plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form briefly, laid down towards the conclusion thereof; at last, perceiving these adversaries pouring out themselves so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, that all hope was taken from me of making answer, though with never so much brevity, unto them all; I took hold of this resolution, to suffer them every man to enjoy the solace of his writing in peace, and to turn my self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my former purpose and ingagement of inlarging my Book of Redemption with a second part. Only I have thought meet to reserve this liberty to my self, in case I shall casually meet with, as either by reading, or hearing, any thing of moment for the relief of their cause, in any of their writings, besides, or beyond all that, which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the arguings of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> or in any other of those arguments, which are briefly set down in the last chapter of my said Book, to take such things into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and give answer (as God shall inable, and direct) unto them. And because, as far as yet the eye of my fore-sight is able to ken, or discern, I am not like, in the course I intend to steer, to meet with any occasion, or opportunity, of speaking little or much to the point of Perseverance, wherein since the coming abroad of my Book of Redemption, I have met with three Antagonists, two Doctors <hi>in folio,</hi> with a Quack-salver <hi>in quarto,</hi> (and possibly there may be more birds abroad of the same feather; for Truth, especially in the day of her affliction and abasement, is like to have enemies enough) I shall upon this account desire the Readers leave and
<pb facs="tcp:65873:19"/> patience to acquaint him in this Epistle, by one instance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how coursly and unworthily, how shamefully and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely, the most versute and versatile Patrons of absolutely decreed Perseverance, and those that are most skilful in the art of fencing and putting by the thrusts of the Sword of the Spirit, are constrained to handle the Scriptures, to salve the <hi>phaenomena</hi> of their Doctrine, I mean, those delusive appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and shews of truth, by which they have commended it to the injudicious world. And if there be any one passage or text of Scripture to be found, out of the hand whereof their Doctrine cannot be delivered but by notorious perverting, wresting, falsifying, evading, blending, or the like, though they could, and should come off more plausibly from the rest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and urged against them, yet is their cause forlorn and lost, capable of no relief by any applications, corroborati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or recruits whatsoever. For certain it is, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Scripture do in any one place condemn, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver justifie in another: the Spirit of God is not divided in himself. And this is one advantage in controversal arguing, which he that pleadeth the affirmative, hath above him that stands ingaged for the negative: if he shall maintain and make good any one argument or proof against his Adversary, though he should fall short and be worsted in all the rest, yet he hath made good his main undertaking. Whereas he that defendeth the Negative, doth not perform his undertaking with success, by answering, though never so fully and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, one, or two, or ten arguments levied against him by his adversary, if there be any one yet remaining, which he cannot answer.

I shall not here transcribe or repeat any thing of it: only I conceive that somewhat of it may be understood by the particulars replyed by those, who contend about it with me. How pitifully they handle, torture, and torment this Scripture, to make it confesse that it intends nothing against them in their cause, when as (indeed) it speaks with open mouth against them, may have a ready access to any mans understanding, that will but diligently and impartially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how importunely they go to work, and plead, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile it.</p>

Besides, when he saith, that <hi>He that draws back, must be any man, rather then he</hi> [the just man] the truth is, that no man is capable of the <hi>drawing back</hi> here spoken of [viz. <hi>unto perdition,</hi> as the next verse explaineth it] but the <hi>just man</hi> only; because all other men are in the state of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> at present. [<hi>He that believeth not,</hi> saith <hi>Christ, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already,</hi> Joh. 3.18.] and therefore cannot be said to draw back <hi>to</hi> it, but from it. Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> being resident amongst the Parishioners of <hi>Grace-Church,</hi> cannot be said to draw back <hi>to</hi> them; but in case he should return to <hi>Blissland</hi> neer <hi>Bodmin</hi> (where he informs us <hi>Woodcocks</hi> are so plentiful) he might truly be said to draw back from them. What he addes, to make it probable that the Apostle here speaks of <hi>a man actually drawn back,</hi> is of the same character of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency with the former: and because he speakes it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well faintly, as weakly, I judge it not worth considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Whereas in further justification of his Friends, the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> in their, <hi>Any man,</hi> he recriminates, and tells me, that <hi>I am fain to put a comment</hi> [if he shall continue] <hi>that I may make the following clause to cohere with the former,</hi> and that, <hi>this,</hi> if he shall continue, <hi>is as much besides the words of the text, as our Translators, or Beza's,</hi> any man. I answer</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is proper and necessary for Expositors, or Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, and so for those that shall argue from a text, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the sense of the text in variety of words differing from the words of the text; but this is not proper for Translators. Tkey ought as much as may be, <hi>verbum verbo reddere.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> here confirms me in my notion about Translators; which is, that for the most part of them, in favour of their own opinion they ever and anon expound, in stead of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating. Yet <hi>Calvin</hi> was more ingenuous in translating the place in hand, then either his Successor, or Mr. <hi>Kendall,</hi> or <hi>Doctor Owen;</hi> for he renders it according to the Original, thus; <hi>Justus autem ex fide vivet: et si subductus fuerit, non oblectabitur, &amp;c. — and if he shall draw,</hi> or be drawn <hi>back, my soul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:65873:21"/>2. Concerning my <hi>Comment, if he shall continue,</hi> I suppose it contains, it imports, nothing but what Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self approveth, <hi>viz.</hi> that only those who shall continue [in faith and love] unto the end, shall be saved. Which also is the expresse Doctrine of Scripture in many places. Yea <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi> in his Expsiotion of the words expresly inserts it. <hi>Satis habet verbis Prophetae, Hebraeis vitam aeternam promittere ex fide, SI EAM RETINƲERINT.</hi> Therefore to what purpose he objecteth it to me here, I wot not. I confesse if I had only undertaken the translation of the place, it had been acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable: but my business being to expound and give the true and full sense of the place, the Comment was pertinent and necessary.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Take it <hi>impersonally,</hi> (as no man yet, that I know, ever took it; only I now hear of one that <hi>seems</hi> to have thus taken it) you take it as <hi>impertinently</hi> to your cause, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For</p>

For to say that <hi>that may very well refer to all men that draw back,</hi> which must necessarily refer to all such, is to affirm that probable, or possible, which is simply necessary.

               </gap>, <hi>taken impersonally,</hi> or by <hi>referring to all men that draw back?</hi> For it is not the truth of what your translation maketh of the place, that I question, but the truth of the translation it self. I readily subscribe unto this, that <hi>if ANY MAN draw back, the soul of God will have no pleasure in him.</hi> But 1. I deny that, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is rightly translated, <hi>but if ANY MAN draw back,</hi> and affirm, that you will never prove it to be rightly so translated until the Heavens be no more.
<pb facs="tcp:65873:21"/> 2. I affirm, that were the Translations by favour yeelded unto you, yet this would not mediate a peace between this text, and your cause; because were it said, <hi>If any man draw back,</hi> the meaning must of necessity be, <hi>If any just man draw back,</hi> for the reason specified; <hi>viz.</hi> because no person is capable of the drawing back here spoken of, or of that which is <hi>to perdition,</hi> but the <hi>just man</hi> only. 3. And lastly, those words, <hi>My soul shall have</hi> [or hath] <hi>no pleasure in him,</hi> plainly intimate, that the soul of God had pleasure in the person, or persons, here spoken of, before this their <hi>drawing back;</hi> otherwise this threatning would signifie nothing; the soul of God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no pleasure (at least in the sense here intended) in any man, or in any sort of men, but in just men only: as he that threatens to kill a dead man, doth but beat the air with his words: they sound nothing of concernment unto any man.</p>

I have no where within me to entertain such a conceit, that this should be Mr. <hi>Kendall's</hi> sense or notion, in his distinction of, <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely considered,</hi> because it is so broadly inconsistent with our common principles, both his and mine. And yet what other sweet morsel of reach and notion he should hide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those words, I confess I am too much benighted in my understanding, so much as to conjecture, or divine. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly these words, <hi>absolutely considered,</hi> will contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards any mans conviction, or satisfaction, but that a possibility of the Saints defection, or drawing back, may be concluded from the Scripture in present debate. 4. (And lastly) Doth not the whole stress and strength of his Essay to deliver his Doctrine of Perseverance out of the hand of that text of Scripture, which fighteth with so high an hand, as we have seen, against it, lie in his adventurous and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less criticism touching the proper sense and signification of the words <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifieth all this long retinue of sense and notion, <hi>viz. not so much to draw back, as to betake a mans self to a place, where he fancieth great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, albeit he leave not a place of strength to go thither;</hi> and again, <hi>that</hi>

Yea, though this be an insupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, an invincible, task for him to perform, neither is he like to overcome it, till the Sun gives over shining; yet hath he a worse Crow to pluck then this, before his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Perseverance be freed from under the arrest of this Scripture. He must prove, not only that the said two words, may have, or that <hi>de facto,</hi> they have, the two significations, which he respectively asserts unto them, but either that they have no other significations, besides these; or that those signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations will not as well, or better, <hi>quadrare</hi> to the scope and context of the place in hand, as any other. But the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drature of a circle is easier to demonstrate, then any quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the said significations to the purport of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: It hath been already proved, that such significations of the words are unto the place in question, <hi>as snow in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and rain in Harvest,</hi> I mean, unsuteable and unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Moreover, though I, being poorly book't, have not had the opportunity of consulting any great variety of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors upon the place; yet none of those I have seen, give the least intimation of any such significations of the two words, as those offered, and refused: and, I am at present rooted and grounded in this Faith, that neither do any of those, whom I have not seen, gratifie Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> any whit more. So then if it be true, that <hi>the Spirits of the Prophets [divisìm] are subject to the Prophets [conjunctìm]</hi> then must Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> be ordered about the signification of words by his Peers the Prophets, and not pretend revelation in opposition to them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65873:25"/>
            <p>Reader, if thou hast set thy heart to those things, that have been now argued before thee, concerning Mr. <hi>Kendalls</hi> vindication of his Doctrine of Perseverance, from what hath been proved against it from that text of Scripture under late consideration, I doubt not but that thy clear sense is, that all that he hath pleaded upon the account, to purpose, may be summed up in a cypher, and no error commited in the computation. As for that little yet behind, the man is in it but <hi>Idem qui pridem:</hi> there is no fresh aid here for his scattered and fainting troops. Yet let him have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of being heard in it: <hi>Subductio</hi> (saith he) <hi>wherein there seems to be an opposition, of the skulking and hiding of infidelity, to the openness and boldness of appearing which is in Faith.</hi> This helps, <hi>pro ratâ,</hi> to swell Mr. <hi>Kendalls</hi> Book: but his cause lies bleeding and pining to death under it: nor is there any thing restorative in it to fetch again the drooping and sinking spirits thereof. However, he seems here to be somewhat more ingenuous, then ordinary; in that he doth not magisterially and with confidence assert the <hi>opposition</hi> he speaks of, which is the usual rate of his asserting, but contents himself with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming an appearance only, or <hi>seemingness</hi> of such a thing. About which apparition I shall not be troublesome unto him, especially upon condition of his yeelding, (wherein I presume he will not be difficult) that there is not so much as any <hi>seemingness</hi> in this period, of any argument or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to prove, that a possibility of the Saints defection (in the sense of the Controversie) cannot be proved out of the Scripture, Heb. 10.38.</p>
            <p>Thus we have unpartially examined all that Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> hath pleaded to vindicate his cause of perseverance from those impleadings of it, which have been levied from the said Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The premises considered, can it enter into the fancy of any reasonable man to imagine, that he should please himself in the success of his undertaking; or (indeed) in any thing, either said or done, by him, in the managing or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of it. Notwithstanding having quitted himself more like a Mouse (as our <hi>English</hi> proverb hath it) than a man, in the
<pb facs="tcp:65873:25"/> engagement, yet as if he had super-Herculized, he triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a great and solemn triumph. <hi>And thus</hi> (saith he) <hi>this Text, which you pretend to be like a King, against whom there is no rising up, leaveth you lying all along at his foot-stool, without holding out his Scepter, yea or his hand or foot to you to kiss.</hi> Whatever (Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi>) this King holds out, or not holds out to me to kiss, with his Sceptre, as with a rod of Iron, he dasheth and breaks your cause in pieces like a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vessel, never to be made whole more. It was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a by-saying in <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Odenatus</hi> conquered, and <hi>Gallienus</hi> triumphed. Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> (it seems) is resolved, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conquers, that he will triumph.</p>
            <p>Only (Reader) I must crave thy pardon for a late over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, into the commission whereof I was (though I confess, somewhat unadvisedly) drawn by Mr. <hi>Kendalls</hi> triumph. For I thought that the battel had been fought and quite ended, before the triumph began; but it seems Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> walks by another rule, which I was not aware of, though (I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) I might well have been, finding him so like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himself, <hi>i.</hi> so unlike other men, at many turns. He hath yet a reserve in <hi>ambuscado,</hi> but of men, whose hands are feeble, as theirs of his main body, and their arms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed: yea himself puts no great confidence in the best of them. And for the rest, they are fitter to act some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant part in a Comoedy upon a Stage, then to do service in the field. I shall not trouble thee nor my self, with a <hi>verbatim</hi> transcribing of the place: thou mayst satisfie thy self with a perusal of it from the Authors own hand, <hi>pag.</hi> 90, 91. of the second part of his <hi>Sancti Sanciti.</hi> Nevertheless because the man (as was lately observed) is so incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so impotently, addicted unto triumphs, and can make victo ies, of worstings, at pleasure, I shall give a brief touch upon what I find material in this his after-birth. <hi>We need not</hi> (he saith) <hi>insist upon the conditional form of the sentence; and yet that</hi> forlorn, <hi>as you call it, hath not been routed by you, as you boast.</hi> I answer</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:65873:26"/>1. Within the compass of these few words he profanes the dignity of <hi>verbum Sacerdotis</hi> twice over; (though this, I confess, is scarse worth the noting here, because he hath done it fourty times over, and ten, in his two books else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) For 1. he chargeth me with <hi>boasting</hi> (it seems, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proverb, that <hi>he museth, as he useth</hi>) that I have <hi>routed</hi> the <hi>forlorn</hi> he speaks of. Bur he neither shews, nor can shew any <hi>boasting</hi> of mine upon such an account. I am for acting: I leave <hi>boasting</hi> for Mr. <hi>Kendall.</hi> 2. He denyeth that his <hi>forlorn</hi> hath been <hi>routed</hi> by me. Herein also he spareth the truth (witness the 275 &amp; 276 pages of my Book of <hi>Redemption</hi>) unless he take Sanctuary under the metaphorical import of the word, <hi>routed.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no need, that the <hi>forlorn</hi> he talks of, should be <hi>routed</hi> by me, when as it hath been <hi>routed,</hi> and dismissed the field,<note place="margin">

               </note> by some of the Field-officers, and chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders themselves on his own side, who were ashamed (it seems) that it should be thought that their Cause stood in need of help from such effeminate sharks, at that. They had the courage to say of this <hi>forlorn:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Non tali auxilio, nec defensoribus istis,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. (and lastly) When he saith, <hi>we need not insist upon the conditional form;</hi> &amp;c. it is sign that himself esteemeth such an insistence, but a <hi>miserable Comforter</hi> unto his cause. When a man is falling from the top of a tree, it argues the twig to be very small indeed, that being within his reach, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth to lay hold of. But he further addes:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas you jest it out here, that if the just man who shall live by his Faith, be in no possibility of drawing back, God must be conceived to speak at no better rate then this; If the just shall do that which is simply and utterly impossible for

For</p>
            <p n="1">1. (Though this be hardly worth the observing, enough <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>28</label> upon the same account having been observed so lately) He here justifies, by owning, that very translation or reading of the later clause in the Text yet under debate between him and me, for which I contend with Our <hi>English</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators, and Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> and have suffered the anger and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Mr. <hi>Kendalls</hi> pen for so doing. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. When he tells me, that he hath <hi>often</hi> told me, that he and his <hi>acknowledge a possibility of the just mans falling, as to himself, yea and an impossibility of his standing;</hi> I here tell him, that I have oft told him, and his, the very self same story, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is <hi>an impossibility of any mans</hi> (and so of the just mans) <hi>standing, as to himself.</hi> Nor do I know any man that ever charged, either him, or any of his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas from his <hi>acknowledging a possibility of the just
<pb facs="tcp:65873:27"/> mans falling, as to himself, yea and impossibility of his standing,</hi> he infers, that <hi>therefore upon these grounds, God speaks not thus, If the just shall do, what is simply and utterly imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssible for him to do, &amp;c.</hi> I would gladly know of him, whether, the <hi>possibility</hi> he speaks of, <hi>of the just mans falling, as to himself,</hi> being granted, there be a possibility of his falling, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any decree or interposure of God for his standing. If so, what means that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that great Book which he hath written against me, for maintaining the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? If not, then how is it not <hi>simply and utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> that He [the just man] should fall? Or is not that <hi>simply and utterly impossible,</hi> which, all circumstances consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and all impedimental opposures allowed, shall not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding certainly be, and cannot but be? So that his <hi>grounds</hi> he speaks of, do no ways deliver him from that grand absurdity of making God to speak thus; <hi>If the just shall do that which is simply and utterly impossible for him to do, I will, or I have no pleasure in him.</hi> Yet</p>
            <p n="4">4. (And lastly, for this) that which <hi>upon his grounds,</hi> he granteth that He and his Symmysts <hi>make God to say</hi> in the text in hand, is altogether as uncouth and absurd as the other. For according to this saying, which he <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth</hi> they put into the mouth of God, they make him to threaten men, yea <hi>just</hi> men, the men of his greatest delight, and this with a sore and most severe threatning, for not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept by him</hi> from that which is evill. Doth God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Friends with ruine and destruction, for his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal to act with them, and this irresistibly, infrustrably, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Salvation? Doubtless it is the neglect, or sin, of the creature, not the righteous suspending, or forbearance of any acting by God, which is the ground of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ture. But it is no news, that the defense of an Error should intangle the wisest men with folly. That which he infers from his former absurdity, is both inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and impertinent. <hi>So that this</hi> (saith he) <hi>may rather shew, that God hath no pleasure in any such as at any time draw back to perdition, then that any in whom God hath pleasure, shall draw back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:65873:27"/>1. The relation between these words and the former, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>29</label> is so above measure subtile, that <hi>non-sense,</hi> and it, as far as my Logick is able to ken, are in the same Predicament. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am somewhat more then of the same mind with Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> in these words, and conceive, that the place <hi>may</hi> much <hi>rather shew,</hi> that <hi>God hath no pleasure in any such, as at any time draw back to perdition, then that any, in whom God hath pleasure, shall draw back.</hi> For 1. I absolutely believe that the place <hi>sheweth, that God hath no pleasure in any such, as at any time draw back to perdition [viz.</hi> when they thus <hi>draw back,</hi> be it sooner, or later, or afterwards] and 2. that it no ways <hi>sheweth, that any man in whom God hath pleasure, SHALL draw back,</hi> but only that they <hi>MAY</hi> draw back. I doubt not but Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> himself knoweth a generous difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>may</hi> be, and <hi>shall</hi> be. I know no man that ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the text in argument, to prove, that just men <hi>SHALL draw back</hi> to perdition, but only that they <hi>MAY</hi> thus <hi>draw back.</hi> That which he hath yet to say, hath as little to do with his cause, as any thing said hitherto. For is it not this, with the appurtenances?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And lastly, we deny, not an actual drawing back of the best of men, and that so far God hath no pleasure in their actions, or services.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="1">1. To what purpose doth he plead, that they <hi>deny not an <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>30</label> actual drawing back of the best of men,</hi> when as they <hi>deny,</hi> not only the <hi>actual,</hi> but even the possible <hi>drawing back,</hi> which is here spoken of [the <hi>drawing back unto perdition</hi>] not only of the <hi>best of men,</hi> but of all good men, without exception? Might he not, altogether with as much perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency to his cause, have professed and said, <hi>We deny not but that Noah</hi> had three sons, <hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet?</hi> And</p>
            <p n="2">2. What he means by this, and <hi>that SO FAR God hath no pleasure in their actions or services,</hi> is (I fear) of too high a speculation for me to attain. Is it this, that <hi>God hath no pleasure</hi> in their <hi>drawings back?</hi> This I confess, is neer enough at hand; but I suspect it too neer, to be his meaning.
<pb facs="tcp:65873:28"/> Or is it this; that so long as they continue in their <hi>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, God hath no pleasure in their actions or services?</hi> If this be it, I would willingly know in what degree of affinity this relateth unto his cause. I am in-apprehensive of any connexion it hath with it. Nor am I so positively clear touching the truth of it. For certain it is, 1. that he that hath <hi>drawn back,</hi> doth not return, before he returns. 2. Is it not as certain, that such a man remains in, or under, his <hi>drawing back,</hi> untill his return? Or is there any interim or space of time between such a mans remaining under his <hi>drawing back,</hi> and his returning? 3. Can any man <hi>act,</hi> or do <hi>service,</hi> but in time, in some time, or other? 4. Is it Mr. <hi>Kendalls</hi> opinion, that the returning of him, who had <hi>drawn back.</hi> is no <hi>action,</hi> or <hi>service,</hi> wherein <hi>God taketh pleasure?</hi> I trow not. Therefore he must give me some better light then yet he hath done, to make me see truth in this saying, that so long as the <hi>best men continue under their drawings back, God hath no pleasure in their actions, or services.</hi> But the pertinency of the saying to the cause in hand, being voided, it is not material, upon that account, to dispute about the truth of it. Besides, God bearing <hi>good will</hi> to the persons of these <hi>drawers back,</hi> even under their drawings back, and before their return (as Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> argueth in the words following) why should not their <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>services</hi> all this while be accepted with God? Or may God <hi>have good will to the persons of men,</hi> and yet all <hi>their actions and services</hi> be an abomination unto him? Or is this any branch of the <hi>Doctrine commonly received by the Reformed Churches?</hi>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>31</label> When he yet adds upon the former score, <hi>In which respect such a passage IS not an unsavoury caution;</hi> neither is it, in such a <hi>respect,</hi> (nor indeed, in any other) affirmed by me, (or any other man, I verily believe) to <hi>be</hi> an <hi>unsavoury caution.</hi> My words, as to this point, are expresly these: <q>What savour of wisdom, yea or of common sense, is there in admonishing, or cautioning men against such evils, which there is no possibility for them to fall into,

               <hi>quidem.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Whereas he demands; <hi>but had God no good will towards their persons, how come they to return?</hi> I answer; if he speaks of those, who <hi>draw back to perdition,</hi> of whom the clause speaketh (as hath been formerly argued, and himself, in part, granted) is not his demand about their return, notably strange? Is it his sense, that there is, or may be, <hi>a return</hi> from <hi>perdition?</hi> There may be (indeed) a return from such a state, which may properly enough be termed, a State of <hi>perdition, [i.</hi> such a state, wherein, if a man dies, he perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever.] But Mr. <hi>Kendall's</hi> sense is, that a <hi>just</hi> person cannot, all things considered, <hi>draw back</hi> into such a state as this, no more, then unto actual <hi>perdition.</hi> And if it were granted him, that <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>bear good will</hi> [in one kind, or in one degree, or other] unto the persons of all men <hi>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back,</hi> so it be on this side of actual <hi>perdition,</hi> I know not what nourishment he can pick out of it for his cause. It is my clear opinion, and I constantly profess it upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and well remember that somewhere I have argued it from the Scripture; that God bears so much good will even to the sinfullest of men, who have not yet sinned the sin unpardonable, as to vouchsafe unto them such a measure or degree of Grace, by a serious and cordial comportment wherewith they may repent, and be saved.</p>
            <p>But that Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> doth not move the question, <hi>how <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>32</label> come they then to return,</hi> about persons <hi>drawing back</hi> to <hi>actual perdition,</hi> appears by these words following: <hi>Sure, it is his hand that leads them home, and it is an especial part of his promise to his people</hi> [it is rather an entire <hi>promise,</hi> then any <hi>part</hi> of a <hi>promise] to heal their back-slidings. So that though they too often draw back, they never draw back so as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but believe to the saving of their souls.</hi> This is the castatrophe of Mr. <hi>Kendall's</hi> negotiation to beget a good intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence between the Scripture in hand, and his Doctrine of Perseverance. But the text (as we have seen all along) is inflexible to any such accommodation; being as a sword
<pb facs="tcp:65873:29"/> passing through the soul of his cause. And for the words now last recited, they both enterfere with what he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly pleaded, and besides have no relation to the place in hand.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He had justified the <hi>English</hi> Translation, which reads, but if <hi>any man draw back;</hi> not, <hi>if he</hi> [the, <hi>just man] draw back,</hi> and had laboured in the very fire to find out such a construction or signification, for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which might appropriate it to hypocrites or hollow Professors, and exempt it from being understood of true believers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the words last mentioned, he will needs have it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of these. Thus though he wriggles, and wrings, and tries this way, and that, to get out the deadly arrow shot from this Scripture into the sides of his Doctrine, yet
<q>—<hi>haeret lateri lethalis arundo.</hi>
               </q>
               <q>Fast sticks the mortal arrow in its sides.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He speaks here of such <hi>drawers back,</hi> who <hi>return,</hi> and to whose <hi>persons</hi> God bears <hi>good will</hi> (as himself lately taught us) even under, and during, their <hi>drawings back:</hi> whereas it is evident (and himself hath acknowledged) that the place speaketh of such <hi>drawers back,</hi> in whom the <hi>soul of</hi> God <hi>hath no pleasure,</hi> and who <hi>draw back unto perdition.</hi> Thus we see that the text so studiously complemented and courted by Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> to be good to him in his cause, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him no mercy at all herein. As for that <hi>part</hi> of Gods <hi>promise</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>to his people, to heal tbeir back-slidings,</hi> he either understands it not, or else doth worse. For God in this promise gives no assurance to those to whom it is made, that how wickedly or stubbornly soever they shall demean themselves towards him, he will by an irresistible power cause them to repent, and return again unto him; the <hi>promise</hi> thus notioned, would be highly encouraging to sin and wickedness, (as is evident.) But that which God intends by this promise, is that upon their repentance and
<pb facs="tcp:65873:29"/> return, he will <hi>heal [i.</hi> will pardon] their <hi>back-slidings,</hi> and make up all those sad breaches in their comforts and peace, which their <hi>back-slidings</hi> had made upon them. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text all along, Hos. 14. (where this promise is recorded) evinceth this to be the genuine sense and import of the said promise. Let the best Expositors upon the place be consulted.</p>
            <p>And for his Conclusion, <hi>So that though they too often draw back, they never draw back so as to perdition,</hi> &amp;c. ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> we must take it for a whole syllogism, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>conclusion</hi> and premises both; otherwise, the credit of it must wholly rest upon the Authority of the Assertor. For nothing hath yet appeared (and yet I think as much as ever will) either from the Scripture, or from reason, to commend it for truth to the judgement of a dis-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged and considering man.</p>
            <p>What hath now been argued against Mr. <hi>Kendall,</hi> from the text, Heb. 10.38. to demonstrate the signal inconsistency of it with his notion and Doctrine of Perseverance, may somewhat more then indifferently serve for an answer to his great Volume, intituled by him, <hi>Sancti Sanciti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us in the next place briefly inquire, whether the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>33</label> good will, which Doctor <hi>John Owen</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Joh. Owen.</note> beareth to the same cause, hath any whit more, or with better success, befriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in his Treaty of according it with the said Scripture. Notice hath been given already, that in his very entrance upon his engagement here, he stumbles at the unhappy stone, against which his Predecessor dash't his foot, and fell, and was broken to pieces; my meaning is, that he stands up to justifie the <hi>English</hi> Translation of the place. <hi>Malis avibus.</hi> Yet he antidates his victory, and triumphs in confidence before the battel. <hi>What small cause</hi> (saith he) <hi>Mr. Goodwin hath to quarrel with Beza</hi> [I knew not, till now, that to reprove modestly, was to <hi>quarrel] or other Translators, and with how little advantage to his cause this text is produced, shall out of hand be made to appear.</hi> It seems then that which the Doctor projecteth, is not really
<pb facs="tcp:65873:30"/> and substantially to prove any thing against me, but only to make something to <hi>appear</hi> to my detriment in my cause. And yet the truth is, that his colours are so dull and dead, that the <hi>appearance</hi> he <hi>makes</hi> is very broken and sub-obscure, and had need be relieved, either by a weak, or prejudicate, fancy in the beholder, to be acknowledged even for such.</p>
            <p>But (Reader) I shall not so far tempt thy patience, as to burthen thee with an intire transcription of all that the Doctor hath penned to turn the captivity of his cause, and to perswade the Scripture under debate to compound with him for the release of his Doctrine, as I made bold to do in my conference with Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> about the same affair: because the Doctor is <hi>supra modum verbosus,</hi> and frequently makes a dark thicket of words the pavilion of his sense and meaning round about them. I shall therefore only exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and this with what brevity may be, partly the truth, and partly the pertinency, of those grounds or suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon which he builds that house of <hi>appearance,</hi> the model whereof was lately presented unto us from his own pen. In case any of his Friends shall suspect that I may suppress, or conceal any thing material offered by him upon the account of our present debate, they may satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by repairing to the <hi>verbatìm</hi> of his own discourse, as it spreadeth it self upon <hi>pag.</hi> 437. &amp; 438. of his large Book of Perseverance. I have, in the days of my vanity on Earth, traversed the Writings of many learned men; but in no field where-ever yet I came, did I ever meet with <hi>Confidence</hi> so lamely and poorly mounted, so pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be-jaded, as in those Quarters of this Doctors discourse, where he attempts the rescue of his cause, out of the hand of the Scripture already debated, and to be debated yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further.

               </gap>, the presumed goodness and warrantableness of such a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, which rendereth the latter clause of the verse under

            <p n="2">2. Notice hath been already given, that Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whom I may without any great error, call the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Founder of the Doctors Faith, in the point of Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, was more ingenuous here, then to force the Original into such a translation, as that the Doctor contends for.

               </gap>, in the later clause of the verse, out of the former, which is regular and agreeable to the known laws or rules of construction: and doth not fetch it, or force it rather, from I know not how many verses backward. <hi>Aretius</hi> renders the words <gap reason="foreign">

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>35</label> 3. The Doctors Translation, <hi>but if ANY MAN,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially unless by his <hi>any man,</hi> he understands (with <hi>Pareus</hi>) any <hi>just</hi> man (and then he gets nothing by the hand of his translation) is extremely un-grammatical, and (I believe) without parallel, either in the Scriptures, or any other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor whatsoever; as <hi>viz.</hi> that a nominative case should be brought over the heads of twelve or thirteen complete pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods between, many of them of a quite differing import one from another, to give construction to a verb; especially when as this verb may be, and this regularly, and without any the least inconvenience, provided of a nominative case neer at hand, and in the same period. If such a liberty as this be granted in the exposition of Scripture, where there is the like opportunity, and no greater necessity, then here, how many uncouth and wilde senses and notions might it produce? yea and how ridiculous would the use of it be at many turns?</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Doctors Translation with his Exposition, <hi>but IF ANY MAN, i.</hi> (as he interprets) but if any Apostate, or any hypocrite, or any unbeliever, (for how he should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of his, <hi>any man,</hi> but unto one, or more, or all of these, I understand not) <hi>shall draw back,</hi> this (I say) dissenseth the place, and putteth a saying into the mouth of God that is altogether unworthy of him. For 1. according to this reading and construing the place, God is made to threaten men for such a sin, of which they are not capable. For unbelievers, hypocrites, and apostates, are in an estate of <hi>perdition</hi> already (as was lately argued against Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi>) and so cannot <hi>draw back to perdition,</hi> which is the <hi>drawing back</hi> here meant and spoken of, as is evident from the following verse. And besides, <hi>just</hi> men themselves or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, are, according to the Doctors own principles, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any other kinde of <hi>drawing back,</hi> but only of that which is unto <hi>perdition,</hi> whether in state, or in act and event. In which respect, if he thought the place to be meant of
<pb facs="tcp:65873:31"/> any other <hi>drawing back,</hi> but this, he had no occasion to be so importunely violent, either for that translation, which now he riseth up in his might to maintain, or against that, for which I, herein seconded with several of his Chief Friends (as we have shewed) do contend. Yet again, that the <hi>drawing back</hi> here intended, is that which is <hi>unto perdition,</hi> appears from the tenor and import of the threatning annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>my soul shall have no pleasure in him;</hi> which plainly implyeth a dis-interessing the person threatned, or <hi>drawer back,</hi> in the grace or favour of God; which doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him that <hi>draweth back</hi> to any degree short of <hi>perdition.</hi> The conclusion from these premises is, that neither hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, nor Apostate, nor unbeliever, can be the nominative case to the verb, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and consequently that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Translation with his Exposition, must, as loth as they are, come down into the dust.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Doctors said Translation (or mis-translation ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>36</label> accompanied with his said gloss, supposeth another supposition as ill becoming the holy Ghost, as the former; <hi>viz.</hi> that God should, and this with an emphatical severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, threaten evil doers with such a judgement or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was inflicted upon them, and under which they were sufferers, before they were threatned with it: as if he should threaten those that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in hell, with casting them into hell. For 1. certain it is, that the <hi>soul of God delighteth not</hi> in any hypocrite, Apostate, or unbeliever: therefore to threaten them with this, is to threaten them with a judgement already upon them. 2. As certain it is, that the judgement here specified, was (at least accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Contra-remonstrant Principles) upon them, before the crime of Apostasie, for which it is here threatned, was found in them. For the <hi>soul of God taketh no pleasure</hi> in men before they profess Religion: and yet a profession of Religion always precedes Apostasie. Especially, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the said principles, the <hi>soul of God hath no pleasure</hi> in such persons before the profession of Religion, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards prove Apostates: because the principles we speak
<pb facs="tcp:65873:32"/> of, award all such for Reprobates. Now a threatning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways respects an execution of somewhat penal, in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and doth not import a preceding execution, or relate to a judgement formerly executed. Besides, to represent God as threatning Apostates with one judgement or other, if, or in case, they shall apostatize, when they have aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized already, is to teach, or tempt the world, to desire wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in him.</p>
            <p>It would be but a slim and slight evasion for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor here to pretend, that these words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>my soul hath no pleasure in him,</hi> contain rather a declaration of Gods present displeasure against Apostates, then a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them with his displeasure in the future. For 1. the latter absurdity, or another greater then it, puts forth in this also. For to make God to declare his present displeasure against Apostates, if, or in case, they shall apostatize, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects altogether as unworthily upon his wisdom, as to make him threaten them upon the same terms. 2. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, reads the words, <hi>if any man shall draw back,</hi> wherein he notions them <hi>minatorie,</hi> and interprets them accordingly. For he makes them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to the words in the former clause, which are evidently promissory, <hi>The just shall live by Faith:</hi> therefore by rhe rule of contraries these must be minatorie, or threatning. 3. (And lastly for this) they are generally, if not universally, so construed by Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>37</label> 5. As was argued before with Mr. <hi>Kendall,</hi> hypocrites and Apostates are not capable of that <hi>drawing back,</hi> which is threatned by God, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>drawing back to perdition;</hi> nor (indeed) any other kind of person, but the <hi>just man</hi> only (as hath been since proved.) Therefore it is not the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, or Apostate, but the <hi>just</hi> man that is here threatned with the loss of Gods favour, in case <hi>HE</hi> shall <hi>draw back,</hi> or apostatize.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Evident it is, that the Apostle here speaks, not to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites or apostates (at least not to such, whom he judged to be such) but to <hi>just</hi> men, or such, of whom he <hi>hoped
<pb facs="tcp:65873:32"/> better things, and such which accompanied salvation.</hi> This (I suppose) needs no proof. Now then to suppose that in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to <hi>just</hi> and good men, he should threaten hypocrites and apostates, is somewhat incongruous; especially unless it be supposed, that these <hi>just</hi> men to whom he speaketh, are obnoxious to the same sin, for which the others are threatned, and thereupon in danger of suffering the same judgement with them. Or what can it contribute towards the edification of <hi>just</hi> men, to hear hypocrites or apostates threatned, when they know themselves securely priviledged by an irreversible, un-frustrable Decree of God, from ever falling into their sin, or partaking in the punishment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it? So that the Doctors translation goes to the wall at every turn.</p>
            <p n="7">7. (and lastly) Himself informeth us, that the Apostle had formerly treated of Apostates, or such, <hi>who by degrees fell off with a total and everlasting back-sliding, describing their ways, and END,</hi> from vers. 25. to vers. 32. If he had so largely <hi>described</hi> both <hi>their ways,</hi> and <hi>their END,</hi> may we not reasonably think that he had now done with them? and that he should not fall upon them a fresh with a new and further threatning, when he had already <hi>described,</hi> and predicted unto them, <hi>their End?</hi> What occasion, or ground, can be imagined, why after this he should threaten them, especially when as this was like to turn to no account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those, in whose audience and presence (as it were) they are threatned, as we lately argued? Therefore the Doctor hath himself put a spoke into his one wheel, which causeth it not to run so merrily.</p>
            <p>These arguments, if not <hi>divisìm,</hi> yet <hi>conjunctìm,</hi> are to <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>38</label> my reason and understanding, abundantly demonstrative, that the <hi>Doctors</hi> reddition, and explication of the clause, are but reprobate silver, and such which will not abide the touch-stone of the fire. I might for further satisfaction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, insist upon such considerations, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to commend and fortifie that translation, together with that sense and import of the place, which commend
<pb facs="tcp:65873:33"/> themselves unto me. As 1. that this translation compo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the Original, without any breach made upon any law or rule of construction, without seeking after a nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native case to the verb, in a far Countrey, &amp;c. 2. That it is attested and imbraced by a great part of our best Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors, yea by many, with whom the Doctor claims sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy in judgement about his Doctrine of Perseverance. 3. That it gives forth clearly and directly such a sense, which very genuinely and naturally agreeth with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, and argument in hand, and which is proper to awaken and excite the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to constancy and perseverance in the profession of the Gospel, &amp;c. 4. That the sense which it directly yeelds, is none other, but what is frequently and familiarly held forth in the Scriptures elsewhere, &amp;c. But to accommodate a long preface wirh as much brevity as may be, I shall leave these to the Readers Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
            <p>But all this while, hath not he that maketh orts of all this hey, somewhat of more value, then either silver, or gold, or precious stones, to say in defence of his transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and notion of the place? I confess if words sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud a lofty confidence, as, <hi>Evidently and beyond all contradiction, The following expression puts it out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, Both on the one hand and the other is our thesis undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably confirmed,</hi> with such like materials; if such arguments (I say) as these be super-demonstrative, then must all that I have argued and said, either in opposition to the Doctors Translation (with the appurtenances) or in confirmation of that asserted by me, give place, and put their months in the dust. But his courage is better then his weapons —<hi>telo{que} animus praestantior omni.</hi> And the truth is, that his reasonings for that, about the truth whereof he is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported with so much confidence, are so transparent and inconsiderable, that I cannot entertain such mean thoughts of his abilities and learning, as not to judge him every ways able, yea and more then able, fairly and fully to answer them himself.

            <p>But, Reader, considering how unsuccessful the Doctor hath been in bringing off his Doctrine of Perseverance from the assault made upon it by the Text of Scripture so largely insisted on in the premises, and that he hath attempted nothing upon this accompt, but wherein he hath by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son despicable in his eye, been palpably foyled; canst thou believe, though it should be told thee, that he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, not content to claim neutrality at the hand of
<pb facs="tcp:65873:38"/> this Text (which was all his Predecessor Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> lift up his heart unto, who yet is not wont to lose any thing for want of asking, or daring) should further challenge an auxiliary correspondence with it, and claim confirmation of his cause from it? Yet this he doth very confidently; his words (amongst many others of a like deficiency in point of truth) being these: <hi>On the one hand, and the other, is our Thesis undeniably confirm'd in this place of the Apostle.</hi> What <hi>undeniably</hi> signifies in the Doctors Books, hath been formerly noted. However, if thou wilt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him willingly, and on his word, he will force thy Faith by a Syllogism; and prove in mood and figure, that the <hi>Testimony produced, is indeed as a King upon his throne, against whom there is no rising up, but yet speaks quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, clearly, evidently, distinctly</hi> (and not beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction too?) <hi>to what is pretended</hi> [by me.] Well, but let us hear what his Syllogism hath to say: it may be this will gather up all that he hath scattered in his loose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and so make him a Saver. Thus then he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth

            </p>
            <p>Although this Syllogism be scarse Orthodox in form, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as many terms in it, as <hi>Westminster-hall</hi> hath in a year, which is one too many for a Syllogism; yet if the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in it, could, contrary to the common Law of Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing, be perswaded to follow the better part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and not the worse, it were like to prove somewhat more passable. For though the major proposition be a little uncouth, and the reason of the consequence in it, out of the reach of my reason, notwithstanding the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ground which the Doctor hath afforded me to descry it; yet is the minor proposition in the syllogism, that which the dead Fly is in the Apothecaries Ointment: and
<pb facs="tcp:65873:38"/> consequently the conclusion must be of kin to it. But the Doctor hath a better conceit of it then so, and draweth the pedegree of it from the Great Apostle himself. <hi>The minor</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the Apostles.</hi> This is roundly said, but not squarely proved. For these words do nothing less then p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>of them that draw back, but of them that believe. Which plainly distinguisheth them that draw back from believers. Anne haec est Doctore digna probatio?</hi> Because <hi>drawers back are distinguished from believers,</hi> doth it follow that <hi>drawers back</hi> never were <hi>believers?</hi> Because sick men are distinguished from healthful and sound men, doth it follow that sick men were never healthful and sound? Or because ignorant men are distinguished from knowing men, must it needs follow that men now ignorant, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knowing? <hi>Georgius Trapezuntius,</hi> though as ignorant as a childe, is able to confute such a consequence. Well: because <hi>hâc non succedit, aliâ aggrediundum est viâ.</hi> The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor will make the <hi>minor</hi> to be the <hi>Apostles,</hi> before he hath done with it, <hi>viz.</hi> if it be possible. Therefore he abouts with it again, thus: <hi>Again, if true believers shall live, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the saving of their souls, in opposition to them that fall away to perdition, then they shall certainly persevere in their faith: for these two are but one and the same: But that true believers shall live, and believe to the saving of their souls, in opposition to them that draw back, or subduct themselves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is the assertion of the holy Ghost. Ergo.</hi> For answer;</p>
            <p>I see that Greatness is not always accompanyed with <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>46</label> Goodness. For the Doctor here tendereth us a large and <hi>great</hi> syllogism: but it is above his learning to make it <hi>good.</hi> For (saving my quarrel to the form of it, as consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ex solis particularibus, ex quibus nihil concluditur: nam in materia contingenti, indefinitae rationem habent particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi>)</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doth not the <hi>major</hi> reason at this low rate of sense: <hi>If true believers shall live and continue to the saving of their souls, then true believers shall live and continue to the saving of their souls?</hi> Or, <hi>to continue to the saving of the soul,</hi> and, <hi>to
<pb facs="tcp:65873:39"/> persevere in their faith, are</hi> not <hi>these two</hi> (as the Doctor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self ingenuously affirms they are) <hi>one and the same?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I would lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of the learned Doctor, whether, <hi>If true believers shall live and continue to the saving of their souls,</hi> though they should not do it <hi>in opposition to them that fall away to perdition,</hi> it would not aswell follow, that <hi>then they shall certainly persevere in their Faith.</hi> If it would, then why is the major impertinently cumbred with this clause, <hi>in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to them that fall away to perdition?</hi> yea, and why is the minor also compelled to bear the same cross?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The sense it self in the major proposition, is neither common, nor hyperbolically excellent. For when it saith, If <hi>true believers shall live,</hi> doth it not speak of eternal life, and <hi>living</hi> for ever? Or doth it speak of living naturally or temporally? If of this latter, <hi>quorsum hoc? vel quid ad I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicli boves?</hi> If of the former, the said clause is very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruously followed with this, <hi>and continue to the saving of their souls.</hi> For is this handsome, or regular; <hi>If true believers shall live</hi> eternally, and <hi>continue [viz.</hi> then or afterwards, or thereupon] <hi>to the saving of their souls?</hi> But let this pass <hi>inter Doctoris venialia.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="4">4. When he saith, that this assertion, that <hi>true believers shall live, and believe to the saving of their souls, in opposition to them that draw back, or subduct themselves to perdition, is the assertion of the holy Ghost,</hi> this must not pass, unless it be either through the fire to be throughly purged, or into the fire, to be consumed; although we have but little here but <hi>cramben bis ter{que} recoctam, toties{que} à mensâ deturbatam.</hi> For the Apostle no where saith, that <hi>believers shall live [viz.</hi> whether they persevere believing, or no: and believing thus, I say as the Doctor saith, <hi>they shall live:</hi> the efore in this he is no antagonist to me, but a synagonist.] Nor doth he any where say, that they <hi>shall believe to the saving of their souls [viz.</hi> whether they will or no, or, whether they shall be diligent and careful to use the means that they may thus believe, or no; the Apostle no where saith that <hi>they shall believe to the saving of their souls,</hi> upon any other terms
<pb facs="tcp:65873:39"/> then these: and upon these, I also say, that <hi>they shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to the saving of their souls.</hi> Therefore all this this while, the Apostle, with whom the Doctor pretends such inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateness of a Theological intelligence, speaks not a word, liitle or much, for his cause, but opens his mouth wide against ir. But of this enough already to convince any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced, and un-delared man; and all such, whose prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are so generous and noble, as to make them more willing <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. But the mischief and misery is, that for (the most part, in such cases as this) <hi>intus apparens prohibet alienum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. (And lastly) the Doctor may be gratified with the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>47</label> grant of his whole syllogism, rush and branch, and yet not gratified in his cause at all. For his conclusion is not, <hi>Therefore ALL true believers shall certainly persevere in their Faith;</hi> but only this, indefinitely; <hi>Therefore true believers shall certainly persevere.</hi> And for this conclusion, it is mine, as well, and as much as his. For I also believe that <hi>true beleivers shall certainly persevere in their Faith, viz.</hi> all such, that shall be conscientiously diligent in comporting with the Spirit of God in the use of means vouchsafed by God to inable, or cause, them thus to persevere. And this is the ridiculous <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of the Doctors <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to overturn all my arguings against his cause, from the Scripture so largely debated in the premises, but to fetch meat also for it out of this Eater and devourer of it.

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in the close he applauds his valour, sings <hi>Io Paean,</hi> and rejoyceth as if he had divided the spoil. <hi>I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume</hi> (saith he) <hi>by this time</hi> [truly he had <hi>presumed</hi> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently all this while,] <hi>Mr. Goodwin is plainly convinced, that indeed he had as good, yea and much better, for the advantage of his cause in hand, have let this witness have abode in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and not entreated him so severely to denounce judgement against that Doctrine, which he seeks by him to confirm.</hi> Surely
<pb facs="tcp:65873:40"/> the Doctor had <hi>by this time</hi> sat so long at his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k, that he was half asleep at the writing of this. For do I <hi>entreat my witness</hi> he speaks of, to <hi>denounce judgement against that Doctrine, which I seek by him to confirm?</hi> A litsle <hi>entreaty</hi> served to perswade him to <hi>denounce judgement against that Doctrine, which I seek by him</hi> to confute.

            <p>Reader, though I have detained thee somewhat long with my negotiations with the Doctor, yet, considering that what I have now treated with him, is all that I shall answer (being indeed as much, as I need to answer, either upon the account of thy Interest or mine own) to a voluminous piece, which, out of the superfluity of his time and leisure (as it seems) he hath written against what I had written about the Perseverance of the Saints, I trust I shall not finde thee difficult in excusing me. I shall a little relieve thy tired patience with a comparative brevity in my tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions relating to some other of my Antagonists.</p>

               <hi>Servant of Christ, dwelling at the sign of the Tun in Norton Fallgate, London.</hi> For though he also hath so far hearkened unto the spirit of delusion, and self-confidence, as to rise up in arms made of paper, and painted with ink, against the Great Truth of God, that Doctrine of Perseverance, which I had with a great and pregnant consent, both of the Scriptures, aad grounds in reason also, maintained; yea and though he entertained at no small cost and charge, so worthy an opinion of his writing in this kinde, as to judge it worthy the Princes of his people, and accordingly made a distribution, or free-will offering of sundry copies of it, unto them; yet the truth is, the man is so purely inconsiderable in his attempt, that I am a little doubtful whether there was any need at all to tell the world of it. The main pillar that bears up the fabrique of his book, (as the very title of it gloriously
<pb facs="tcp:65873:40"/> overtureth) is that rotten, senseless, Anti-evangelical, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomish</hi> notion or principle, which turns up the Gospel by the ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y roots of it; <hi>viz.</hi> that Faith in God, or in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> is no condition of the New Covenant, or Covenant of Grace, upon which the justification, or salvation of men are by God suspended; but that he hath, not only absolutely and irrespectively decreed to confer these upon certain men, but also hath thus absolutely and irrespectively decreed to confer them absolutely and irrespectively upon these men, without requiring any thing at all of them, in order to their investiture with them. The weak man (it seems) is not able to conceive or comprehend, how the Covenant of Grace; should be a Covenant of Grace, or absolutely and soveraignly free, in case Faith, or any other service or performance, should be required by God of men, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a condition, for the obtaining of the good things covenanted therein, as justification, adoption, salvation, &amp;c. And truly he that is not able to understand this, I can hardly look upon him as a man, that hath as yet attained the A. B. C. of Evangelical knowledge: much less as a man competent to engage in any Controversal Divinity. The Grace, or freeness of the Grace, of the New or Gospel Covenant, standeth not in this, that God therein promiseth unto men, one or other, the great good things mentioned therein, without requiring any terms or conditions of them for the obtaining them at his hand; but it standeth in this, that whereas all mankinde, even <hi>Adams</hi> whole posterity, was by his fall obnoxious to the judgement and just severity of God, and so God at perfect liberty, whether he would stretch forth any hand of deliverance at all, or upon any terms whatsoever, unto them, or no; yet was graciously pleased to offer them reconciliation, life and peace, through the bloud of his Son <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> upon the terms declared by him in the Gospel, <hi>viz.</hi> such a faith or belief in this his Son, which worketh by love. So that though God should have required harder or higher terms and conditions of men, then now he hath done, for the obtaining of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb facs="tcp:65873:41"/> salvation, and other the good things contained in the Covenant, yet the freeness of the Grace in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant would not hereby have been impaired; at least the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant would have been a Covenant of free grace notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, because God was no ways bound to make any Covenant at all with men, by which it should be any ways possible for them ever to be justified or saved. And in this (I suppose) all Mr. <hi>Lambs</hi> learned Friends, who joyn with him against me in the point of Perseverance, will joyn with me against him. So that this Mr. <hi>Lamb</hi> may take Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> by the one hand, and Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> by the other, and bespeak them thus:
<q>
                  <hi>Scribimus indocti, docti{que} poëmata passìm.</hi>
               </q>
               <q>Unlearn'd, and learn'd, we poems write amain.</q> The Doctor began to him, and me, and others with part of the verse, saying to us, <hi>Scribimus indocti, docti{que}</hi>— but he needed not have boggled at the the two other words, but might truly enough have gone on with, <hi>poëmata pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sìm.</hi> For his learned Self, and this unlearned wight, and many others of either character, have written figments in abundance about the point of Perseverance, to please fancies accompanied with over-credulous, and under-industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, understandings.</p>
            <p>Yet this Mr. <hi>Lamb</hi> also, hath (it seems) found somewhat to say (though by himself; for learning, and ignorance, do not often jump) to pacifie that text of Scripture of which so much hath been lately argued, that it may suffer his conceit of Perseverance to pass quietly by it, and without opposition. But his descant (good Reader) upon the place, is so extremely immusical, that thine ears, (I fear) would give me small thanks to invite them to the hearing of it. And yet he also, in the midst of his darkness, hath his, <hi>EVIDENT IT IS,</hi> [and afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wards, <hi>it plainly appears</hi>] as well as Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> his. <hi>Evident it is</hi> (saith he) that <hi>the
<pb facs="tcp:65873:41"/> scope of the Apostle is to describe a man to be just by his living by Faith.</hi> The broken construction and sense in this one short sentence, gives sufficient and timely warning that it would be but lost labour to transcribe, or insist upon, that which follows; But when he saith, <hi>Evident it is that the scope of the Apostle is to describe a man to be just by his living by Faith,</hi> he puts all his learned party, who have expounded the place before him, to rebuke, charging them (in effect) with being so blinde, as not to see that which is <hi>evident.</hi> For though I have not had the opportunity of consulting all that have written upon the place, yet some of them I have seen, and have ground in abundance to believe, that none of them ever scoped the place with Mr. <hi>Lamb.</hi> To say, that the <hi>Apostles scope is to describe a man to be just</hi> by one thing, or other, is not common sense. <hi>Pareus</hi> denies that the scope or intent of the Apostle was to cite the saying of the Prophet, <hi>The just shall live by Faith,</hi> for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or establishment of the righteousness of Faith (which yet is by many degrees more likely to have been his scope, then that which Mr. <hi>Lamb</hi> assigneth) but that all which he intendeth here, is to <hi>promise unto those, to whom he writes, salvation by Faith, if they shall retain it</hi> unto the end. What follows in Mr. <hi>Lambs</hi> discourse upon the occasion, is a meer medlie, chaos, and confusion: the several sayings in it hang together <hi>velut aegri somnia,</hi> like a sick mans dreams: <hi>But</hi> (saith he, about the middle of it) <hi>if just and righteous persons did draw back, then was the Apostle and other believing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews of them, though not the very persons, yet of them,</hi> viz. <hi>of the same nature and kinde,</hi> viz. <hi>just and righteous persons, this the Apostle denyeth; therefore these were not just and righteous persons, &amp;c.</hi> They that can make either head or foot, or any thing, of such discourse, as this, I envy them not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their faculty, or felicity: but it is no company for my understanding. Yet this man also hath learned to <hi>sacrifice unte his not</hi> (as rent and torn, as it is) and <hi>to burn incense to his drag,</hi> though he hath caught nothing with it. For did he not lift up his pen to these words (towards the close of
<pb facs="tcp:65873:42"/> this business) <hi>Thus then it plainly appears</hi> [as plainly, as a mans nose upon the back-side of his face <hi>that Mr. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win alleadging the Original, reading the word, [if he draw</hi> back] <hi>and blaming the translation for substituting</hi> [if any m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And to do this effectually, he tells the world that Mr. <hi>Goodwin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging the Original, is but a meer flourish of words.</hi> I cannot but from my soul, and as in the presence of God, deeply commiserate the sad case of those souls, who have committed themselves unto the ducture and guideance of a person so unexpert in the word of righteousness, so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the counsel and minde of God in the Gospel, in things appertaining unto God, and which so nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their everlasting estate and condition. But thus much, (and this haply much more then enough) for answer to Mr. <hi>Tho. Lamb,</hi> dwelling at the sign of the <hi>Tun,</hi> and his Book of Perseverance; in which, though he stiles himself <hi>a servant of Christ,</hi> yet he hath done service to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est enemy, though (the best is) no great service to him nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

If either of these be the sense of the said <hi>complicate noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the opinion declared and expressed by it, is so ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous before my apprehension, that I shall forbear to argue the ridiculousness of it, lest Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> should take an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereby to say, or think, that that had befallen him, of which <hi>many of his Friends,</hi> (it seems) had given him warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beforehand, <hi>viz.</hi> that he <hi>must expect from me, instead of a reply, nothing but a libel.</hi> And because I know not what some men will please to call, a <hi>libel,</hi> or particularly whether they will thus call the setting forth of an error, or fond notion, or saying, in the proper colours of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or ridiculousness of them, I shall be very tender, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in what I shall have to do with Mr. <hi>Jeans,</hi> of this also.</p>

            <p n="1">1. That I <hi>undertake no refutation</hi> of the Author he speaks <label type="milestone">

            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:65873:45"/>2. In case I had been as well <hi>versed</hi> in Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> himself, and had known his sense and notion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>permissive decrees</hi> of God, where he doth <hi>ex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesso</hi> declare himself in the point, as fully and distinctly as he presumeth himself doth, yet I know not that I stood bound by any Law either of conscience, or ingenuity, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with passages of a contrary import (or at least which seemed such unto me) in his writings elsewhere, to forbear the profession of my dislike of the sense and import of these, unless I should have annexed an explication, or an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, of his judgement to the contrary in other places. I confess I have suffered upon somewhat a like account from some others also, who have ente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed a contest with me, because I sometime cite passages and sayings out of <hi>Calvin, Musculus,</hi> and others, as clearly and fully consenting with me in my judgement about Redemption, Perseverance, &amp;c. whereas (say they) it is sufficiently known that they in other places were of a contrary opinion. But if Authors be not steady or uniform in their conceptions, or expressions, he that hath occasion to cite any thing which he occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally meeteth with in their writings, whether it be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that soundeth on the right hand, or somewhat on the left, is not bound, either to cite, or to signifie, their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site judgements or sayings elsewhere; how much less, when he knoweth not that they do express themselves to the contrary any where besides? which is my case at present. For I clearly and ingenuously profess to Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> (and so shall part wrth him at this turn) that had I been so well <hi>versed</hi> in Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> as to have known, and remembred, the tenor and import of those passages, wherein he so fully (it seems) declareth his judgement touching the <hi>permissive Decrres</hi> of God, I think I should rather have <hi>permitted</hi> the margent of my Book to stand em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mr. <hi>Jeanes,</hi> after the labour and pains of many leaves <label type="milestone">

I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I am surprized with an Antagonist at this turn, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming that if I escaped that generation of men, which Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> calleth, <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny all manner of fore-knowledge in God, in respect of future contingents (though Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> seems to charge them deeper then so) that I should not have been put to trouble or rebuke by any, who call themselves <hi>Christians,</hi> for ascribing unto God that which is more perfect in stead of that which is less. But I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> that there are some, even of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that are of this belief, that it is more agreeable unto truth, to attribute things of a lower and lesse perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, unto God, then things of a more perfect and excellent. For (doubtless) knowledge, and so fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by way of eminency, are more perfect, then in their formal and proper natures; (<hi>i.</hi> in my logick and meaning) then considered as they are in any created subject, men, or Angels.</p>
            <p>But before we come to joyn issue with Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>55</label> about this, I must (by the way) reprove my Reprover for that Contra-Remonstrant infirmity, which, like an unclean spirit, haunts Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> his opinions (I think) where-ever, or by whomsoever, entertained; I mean, his notorious depraving and mis-representing of the opinion of his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>srry.
<pb facs="tcp:65873:46"/> For because I deny <hi>prescience or fore-knowledge to be formally or properly</hi> in God, Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> insinuateth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly argueth, against me, as if I denyed all presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or fore-knowledge in God. If this be not the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of these lines following, my soul knoweth not the way into their secret. <hi>But that Christian Divines</hi> (saith he) <hi>either ancient, or modern (unless you will appropriate that name unto Socinians) are so unanimous in impugning Gods fore-knowledge</hi> [as if I affirmed them so to be] <hi>is great news un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> me [news I believe that was never told him] <hi>and not only unto me, but unto all others, I believe</hi> [and so I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve too] that <hi>have read any thing, either in ancient, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divinity.</hi> That which follows is to the same tune of dis-ingenuity: <hi>Hierom in his third Book</hi> adversus Pelagianos <hi>teacheth (as</hi> Franciscus Amicus <hi>informs me) that he who takes away prescience from God, takes away the Godhead.</hi> And who thinks otherwise? He harps on still on the same string: <hi>As for</hi> Austin, <hi>whom you quote in the margent, against this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of GOD, let any one read that place but now quoted, and he must needs confess that he is a zealous Assertor of Gods fore-knowledge.</hi> Reader, if there be one word, letter, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in that place of <hi>Austin,</hi> which he would have read, and which himself cites that it may be read, that either affirmeth fore-knowledge in God <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>properly,</hi> or that denyeth it to be in him <hi>eminently,</hi> I neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>Austins</hi> Latine, (though this be plain enough, at least in this place) nor yet Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> his English in his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of him, though I make no question but he hath translated his words without letting slip any advantage that might be made of them to serve his turn. He runs on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the way of the same unworthiness, telling thee and me, <hi>that Mr. Hoord,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Mason, tells us that the Fathers did generally make sin an object of Gods prescience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they maintained that there was prescience in God;</hi> as if he would make me believe, whether I will or no, that I deny it. Reader, I have as yet followed him scarse the one half of that way, by which he is running away with
<pb facs="tcp:65873:46"/> my opinion into the land of forgetfulness: yet I fear that I have wearied thee, as well as my self, in drawing thee after him thus far. The truth is, that when I had perused this limb of his discourse, I was ready to cast away the book from me, as judging that man unworthy all Scholar-like, ingenuous, or friendly communication, who cannot be content that his adversary should be thought to be a man, though never so inferior in learning, parts, and knowledge, to himself, but must have him judg'd a monster, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly dresseth him in such an opinion, which may reflect the shape and appearance of such an horrid creature on him. Nor am I as yet to any such degree recovered out of my fit of indignation, as to take any pleasure or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in conferring with his <hi>Genius</hi> in the sequel of his discourse. I shall therefore only give a brief account of those my conceptions about the knowledge and fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, at which Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> makes himself so highly agrieved, and so conclude with him. And herein I shall now use the more brevity, because I remember that I have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the discourse it self upon this subject with Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall:</hi> who though he deridingly quarrels at me for denying knowledge, and fore-knowledge to be <hi>formally and properly</hi> in God, yet he no where insinuates any such bloudy charge against me, that I deny prescience or fore-knowledge to be in God. I shall therefore first shew what I mean by knowledge, and fore-knowledge, <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Secondly, I shall account why I do not, can-not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, either knowledge, or fore-knowledge in this kinde, I mean, properly and formally so called, in God.</p>
            <p>For the former. A thing may be said to be such, or such, so, or so, four several ways, or in a fourfold consideration. (haply in some others also) 1. Formally and properly. 2. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalently. 3. Metaphorically or analogically. 4. and lastly, eminently, or transcendently.</p>
            <p>First, a thing (in my understanding) is said, or may be said, to be <hi>formally and properly,</hi> such or such, or, so and so, when it hath the proper nature and intrinsecal form of that
<pb facs="tcp:65873:47"/> which is primarily, or principally signified by that name, or term, whereby it is called. In opposition hereunto, a thing may be called either <hi>equivalently</hi> such, or metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, and <hi>analogically</hi> such, or eminently or transcendently such. A thing may be said to be equivalently such, when it is of a like, or equal, use, or service, or of equal inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience or disservice, with another, at least in respect of some particular, and yet hath not the same nature or intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal form with it. A thing may be said to be meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically or analogically such, when it carrieth some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance or similitude in it, either in outward form and shape, or in some property and quality with another, and yet hath not the same nature, definition, or internal form with it. Lastly, a thing may be said to be eminently or transcendently such, when it produceth the same kinde of effect with another, but much more perfectly, not having the same nature or specifical form with this thing, but that which is better and more perfect. The matter in hand leadeth us to somewhat a more narrow contemplation of the first and last members of this fourfold distribution, then of the two between them.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>56</label> To know then when a thing is, or may, truly be said, to be <hi>formally</hi> or <hi>properly</hi> such, consideration is to be had, whether it be the same thing, I mean for kinde or in specie, or (which is the same) whether it hath the same nature, specifical form and definition, with that thing, which is primarily signified by the same term, or word, with it. As for example; <hi>Sarah</hi> is said to have <hi>laugbed,</hi> Gen. 18.12. and God is said to <hi>laugh,</hi> Psal. 2.4. and elsewhere.

<pb facs="tcp:65873:47"/> the word, <hi>laughter</hi> will determine the case. If this word, doth primarily, and in the best known signification of it, signifie such a kinde of action, or behavior, as that which under the word, <hi>laughter,</hi> is attributed unto God, then <hi>laughter</hi> is <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> in God, and was not such in <hi>Sarah.</hi> For evident it is, that it could not be <hi>formally and properly</hi> such, in both; because that action or gesture of <hi>Sarah</hi> signified by her <hi>laughing,</hi> was of a far differing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and consideration from that ascribed unto God under the same name. Or if the word <hi>laughter,</hi> doth primarily or more famously signifie some other kinde of action or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, specifically differing from that which in <hi>Sarah</hi> is called <hi>laughter,</hi> neither was her <hi>laughter formally</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> such; but such only, either by way of equivalency, analogy, eminency, or the like. But if the word, <hi>laughter,</hi> in the primary, principal and best known signification of it, signifieth that very kinde of action and gesture wherein <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> expressed herself, when she is said to have <hi>laughed,</hi> then was <hi>laughter formally</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> in <hi>Sarah,</hi> or <hi>Sarah</hi> may be said to have laughed <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>properly;</hi> which is the apparent, and so generally acknowledged, truth. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise if the word, <hi>singing,</hi> or to <hi>sing,</hi> in the primary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and best known signification of it, signifieth and denoteth that very kinde of action, wherein <hi>Moses</hi> and the children of <hi>Israel</hi> expressed thtmselves, when they are said to have <hi>sung,</hi> then did these sing <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally;</hi> and the valleys with corn, in some other sense or considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, as <hi>viz.</hi> metaphorically or analogically, &amp;c. For neither do, or did, these at any time <hi>sing</hi> in such a sense or signification of the word, as that wherein the said action of <hi>Moses</hi> and the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> is expressed. This for explication of the first thing propounded; <hi>viz.</hi> when, or upon what account, things may be said to be <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> such or such, so or so, or such, or so, only in some other respect, or consideration.

For created wisdom is not in God</hi> [he means, <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally,</hi> for that it is <hi>eminently</hi> in him, he had affirmed in the words immediately preceding] <hi>for thus it is an accident, and a finite porfection: and there is the same reason of other the like.</hi> I am so far from understanding either Mr. <hi>Jeanes,</hi> or his Tutor <hi>Suarez,</hi> that I understand not my self, or mine own opinion, if it be not as plainly and distinctly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and attested in these last words of <hi>Suarez,</hi> as I am able to express it my self. Neither could Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> lightly imagine that I should speak of increated <hi>knowledge,</hi> or <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> when I affirmed both the one and the other to be in God <hi>eminently</hi> only, and not <hi>properly</hi> or <hi>formally.</hi> For 1. if these be not <hi>properly</hi> in God, in what subject should, or could, I imagine, they should be in besides? Again it had been a very absurd saying in me, had I said that <hi>increated knowledge</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> are <hi>eminently</hi> in God. For this would have implyed that they had been in some other
<pb facs="tcp:65873:51"/> subject, besides God, <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally.</hi> These things considered, it is little less then evident to me, that Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> his minde to contend at this turn, was much greater then his occasion or opportunity. And this I may truly say like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise concerning all his other contests, and liftings up of his pen against me.</p>

But knowledge and foreknowledge, are perfections of this kinde. Ergo.</hi> To this argument I answer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That were it as fair as <hi>Absalon,</hi> having from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head, no blemish in it, yet <hi>Quid ad rhombum, vel ad</hi> Iphicli <hi>boves?</hi> it concludeth nothing against my sense or notion, when I deny <hi>knowledge,</hi> or <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> to be properly or <hi>formally</hi> in God. The object of my denyal in this kinde, is not that kinde of <hi>knowledge,</hi> or <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> of which the argument speaks, and which I look upon as <hi>Ʋtopian,</hi> but that in both kinds which is found in the creature, as being best known, and to which the words of, <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> both in their ordinary, and in their primary, acception and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (as hath been argued) do agree. And that these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, under this consideration, are neither <hi>formally,</hi> nor <hi>properly</hi> in God, but <hi>eminently</hi> only, we have shewed from the express words of the Jesuite himself, who I believe was the Grand animator of Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> to engage in this duel, to be his sense and opinion also. Therefore if Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> be of <hi>Suarez</hi> minde, as he seems all along the present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate to be, he is of mine also in that, wherein notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Yea they who shall ascribe unto him only such perfections, as particularly of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> as these, are the men who deny all, both <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> unto him. He that keeps no Dog but <hi>Cerberus,</hi> may bark at thieves himself: and he that hath no better harbour, then a Castle in the air, may suffer extremity enough from winde and weather. And if God hath no other <hi>knowledge</hi> in him, but only that, which is neither <hi>created,</hi> nor <hi>increated,</hi> he shall have only that, which is Hyper-<hi>utopian,</hi> and which will stand him in no stead.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If God hath that <hi>knowledge</hi> in him <hi>eminently,</hi> which is in the creature <hi>formally,</hi> (which we have heard to be the sense both of Master, and scholar) and that <hi>knowledge</hi> also, which doth <hi>praescindere &amp; à creatâ, &amp; ab increatâ,</hi> then hath he two kindes of knowledge in him specifically distinct the one from the other. For that <hi>knowledge</hi> which is <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> in the creature, is either a quality, habit, act, or the like; whereas that <hi>abstractissima scientia, quae praescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit a creatâ, &amp; increatâ,</hi> which <hi>Suarez</hi> vests <hi>formally</hi> in God, is either <hi>non ens,</hi> nothing, no <hi>knowledge,</hi> at all, or else such a <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> which is specifically, yea generically, yea <hi>toto genere,</hi> distinct from the <hi>knowledge</hi> proper to the creature, and which they both grant and affirm to be <hi>eminently</hi> in God, it being neither quality, nor habit, nor act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Therefore if there be such an <hi>abstractissima scientia,</hi> such a <hi>knowledge</hi> which abstracteth both from that which is created, and that which is increated, in God, as the <hi>Jesuite</hi> placeth <hi>formally</hi> in him, then must this <hi>knowledge</hi> be as well predicable of such <hi>knowledge</hi> which is created, as of that whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. That <hi>knowledge</hi> which abstracteth both from created, and increated, is not the same essentially; or in definition, with either.

Now if the <hi>knowledge</hi> which is <hi>formally</hi> in God, subsists in the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted knowledge</hi> of men, it must subsist here more <hi>determinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and with more actuality, then it doth in God himself, and consequently be more perfect. For the more indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and potential any thing is, it is so much the more imperfect. Yea, if the knowledge, which is <hi>formally</hi> in God, and this neither created, nor increated, subsists, or exists, in the knowledge of <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. then is there that in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of men, which is neither <hi>created,</hi> nor <hi>increated,</hi> [or, not <hi>created</hi>]. And what that is, which is neither created, nor not created, will require as great an Oracle as Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> his acumen to declare.</p>
            <p n="7">7. (And lastly) If the knowledge, which is <hi>formally</hi> in <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>63</label> God, be neither <hi>creata,</hi> nor <hi>increata,</hi> but abstracteth from both, then doth it in the very <hi>formal conception</hi> of it <hi>include imperfection;</hi> which yet the <hi>Jesuite,</hi> contradictiously enough to himself, absolutely denyeth. The reason of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is: because that which abstracteth from two, or more, species, is <hi>aliquid generale, seu indeterminatum,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is general, and indeterminate. And that which is <hi>indeterminate,</hi> or <hi>potential,</hi> as such, includeth in the precise consideration, or <hi>formal conception</hi> of it, imperfection. If Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> shall here plead his Masters cause, and say, though that which is <hi>indeterminate,</hi> under the precise consideration of its indeterminateness, and as such, includes imperfection in the <hi>formal conception</hi> of it; yet that absolute nature, or form, which is <hi>indeterminate,</hi> doth not in such a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration include imperfection; I answer; 1. That if the
<pb facs="tcp:65873:53"/> very nature, or form it self be really and essentially inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate, that is, imperfect, it must needs include im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in the precise consideration or conception of it, and not only as it is indeterminate; otherwise it self should not be included in this conception, indetermination or imperfection essentially cleaving unto it. But 2. the exception, were it in it self material, yet hath it no place in the case in question. For that knowledge which <hi>Suarez</hi> vesteth <hi>formally</hi> in God, he vesteth it in him in the precise consideration of its indeterminateness, <hi>viz.</hi> as it abstracteth or prescindeth from knowledge created, and increated: for this is the description or definition which he gives of it.</p>
            <p>By this time I think it is apparent enough, that Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> hath made small earnings of his warring under the <hi>Jesuites</hi> banner against me, about the knowledge and fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God. For first, in some passages cited from him, he brings him upon the stage, subscribing (as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) very expressly my sense and notion, about them; and affirming, that <hi>knowledge</hi> in a sense (which I have shewed to be mine, aswell as his) is not <hi>properly,</hi> or <hi>formally,</hi> but only <hi>eminently</hi> in God. And this attribution, or manner of speaking, of the knowledge (and so of the fore-knowledge) of God, is (questionless) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the safest and best becoming the incomprehensible nature of God. 2. Whereas in other passages from him, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth him as placing another kinde of <hi>knowledge</hi> in him <hi>formally,</hi> this hath been sifted with a sieve of vanity, and sufficient proof made, that the <hi>knowledge</hi> which he ascribeth unto God upon these terms, is but sister to the winde.</p>

But this scandal is so broad, that it would be but needless expence of time to measure it. He saith, (being yet scarse entred upon his discourse,) that he <hi>perceives me to be a man well under-layed with a stock
<pb facs="tcp:65873:56"/> of boldness.</hi> The Gentleman (I doubt not) well knoweth, that <hi>Ʋprightness hath boldness:</hi> yea and that <hi>great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus,</hi> is the <hi>purchase</hi> of a faithful and <hi>good ministery,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.13.

But if Mr. <hi>How's</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, that I have more <hi>boldness,</hi> or another kinde of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then becometh me, and this his meaning be according to the truth, then I <hi>perceive</hi> the <hi>English</hi> proverb taking place, which admonisheth, that <hi>It is ill halting before a cripple.</hi> And had I known the Gentleman aswell <hi>à parte antè,</hi> as now I do <hi>à parte pòst,</hi> and had known withall that he would have been a spectator, I should not have been so indiscreetly <hi>bold,</hi> as to appear upon the stage to act a part of <hi>boldness</hi> before him. But reciprocrations in this kinde, I confess are no mans Benefactors: I have done with them. Only this I may say (I presume) without offence, though I had rather that he should be reproveably <hi>bold,</hi> then my self, yet I had rather he should charge me with such <hi>boldness,</hi> then I him. However they who have known me all along from my youth up, until some few years past, very well know, that however I was compassed about with sinful infirmities otherwise, yet did I never ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deserve, or bear, the blame of <hi>boldness,</hi> but always of the contrary. Only since God was pleased to call me out of the retirement of my unprofitable bashfulness, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter men of Mr. <hi>How's</hi> fore-head, he hath somewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the property of mine and made me,, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> of old, an <hi>iron pillar, and brasen wall,</hi> against them.</p>
            <p>But I must needs inquire a little into Mr. <hi>How's charge;</hi> which is, <hi>that my works are all along full fraught with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions</hi> of that forlorn character, which he describeth as we heard; <hi>viz.</hi> such which have <hi>neither stabiliment of Scripture, evidence of reason, &amp;c.</hi> Nay presently after he chargeth me
<pb facs="tcp:65873:57"/> yet deeper then so, informing the world against me with this sore information, that <hi>there are Catalogues extant by better hands then his, of heterodox and impious passages of mine in ALL my works, &amp;c. Bona verba, quaeso, frater mi.</hi> What? <hi>Catalogues extant of heterodox and IMPIOƲS passages IN ALL my works?</hi> and none of them ever come to my, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands, or ears? Be it granted that Mr. <hi>Needhams hand</hi> is <hi>better</hi> then his, yet his <hi>Catalogue</hi> in this kinde was not <hi>extant,</hi> when Mr. <hi>How</hi> made the passionate adventure of such a saying: Besides, there are several of my <hi>works,</hi> which contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards Mr. <hi>Needhams catalogue;</hi> yea far the greater part of them are no benefactors unto him in this kinde. But it is more like, that Doctor <hi>Kendalls hand,</hi> is the <hi>hand</hi> upon which he puts this signal honor, to call it a <hi>better hand</hi> then his. For this <hi>hand</hi> hath scratched him where (it seems) it itched; having gratified him with the figure <hi>hyperbole</hi> in a recommendatory, whereunto the Doctor himself confesseth that he was <hi>earnestly solicited,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Manus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num fricat.</note> prefixed before his discourse. And then, that (according to the Latine proverb) one <hi>hand</hi> should scratch, or rub, another, is but matter of course. But</p>
            <p>Concerning Doctor <hi>Kendalls catalogue;</hi> First, neither have <hi>ALL my works</hi> aided him in this building. There are twenty of them, and ten, which are inocent of this offence, in all which it doth not appear that he found any thing to strengthen his hand in that work. Nay</p>
            <p n="2">2. His <hi>catalogue,</hi> though extravagant enough, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth and containeth it self, within the bounds of my book of Redemption, and doth not forrage any other of my writings for materials, or supplies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That many particulars in this <hi>catalogue,</hi> are either forg'd, or falsified, and are no passages or sayings of mine, I have made sufficiently apparent in the discourse in hand.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For many of those that are <hi>bonâ fide</hi> here set down, and are truly my sayings, I have given them <hi>stabiliment,</hi> either from <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Reason,</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi> or from all, and have fully justified and acquitted them, not only from the charge of being <hi>impious,</hi> but of being <hi>heterodox</hi> also;
<pb facs="tcp:65873:57"/> if we take the word, <hi>heterodox,</hi> as opposed to <hi>orthodox TRƲLY</hi> so called; and not, as now it seems to be frequently taken, for <hi>Orthodox</hi> only so called.</p>
            <p>But as for a <hi>catalogue of heterodox and impious passages out of all my works,</hi> I have neither seen, nor heard of any <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> from any <hi>hand</hi> whatsoever; and have firm ground un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me to stand upon it, that there is no such, no not in the conscience or belief of Mr. <hi>How</hi> himself, but only in the evil distemper of his spirit. Therefore he that affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth such a thing, hath the greater sin. Amongst my <hi>works,</hi> there is one, as large (or near upon) as any other of them (excepting only that of Redemption) written against <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism.</hi> I thought this had been <hi>Gratum opus Agricolis,</hi> and had had nothing, either <hi>heterodox,</hi> or <hi>impious,</hi> in it.

Only concerning some of them, I have heard it questioned by some (I suppose of Mr. <hi>How's</hi> judgement in the <hi>Dort</hi> controversies) whether they were mine, or no: The reason, I judge, was, because they could meet with nothing in them, on which so much as colourably to fasten the imputation, of either <hi>heterodox,</hi> or <hi>impious.</hi> I might instance in several other pieces of mine, none of which were (I believe) ever yet <hi>cataloguized</hi> by any man upon the account of guilt either in the one kinde, or the other. And for the <hi>Catalogue</hi> which Mr. <hi>How</hi> hath made with his own <hi>hand,</hi> consisting of four particulars drawn consequence-wise, not transcribed, out of my <hi>Pagans Debt and Dowry,</hi> and voted by him <hi>heterodox,</hi> and <hi>impious,</hi> we shall, after a few lines interveening, make it appear (I doubt not) but that his vote it self in this kinde, is <hi>heterodox,</hi> and, by as good consequence as any he makes in drawing out the said particulars, <hi>impious.</hi>

Another part of them (not much, if any thing, less then the former) consists of <hi>evident reasons</hi> and grounds, for the proof of the same <hi>assertions</hi> (I speak now chiefly of my Book of Redemption, not excluding others) A third part, commensurable (I believe) to either of the former, consists of <hi>Authorities,</hi> to <hi>patronage</hi> and countenance the same <hi>assertions</hi> still.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. (And lastly, for this) Concerning such <hi>assertions</hi> as Mr. <hi>How</hi> characteriseth (as we have heard) I am so far from knowing that (which he reporteth) that <hi>my works ALL along are FƲLL with them,</hi> that I know not any one such in all my <hi>works;</hi> unless he estimates and measures all the said characters by the crooked rule of his own prejudicate and servile fancy, or (which is not much differing) by the fancies of men as deeply baptized into a spirit of the same prejudice, as himself, calling nothing <hi>stabiliment from
<pb facs="tcp:65873:58"/> Scripture,</hi> or <hi>evidence of reason, &amp;c.</hi> but only what his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples will authorize for such. So that Mr. <hi>How's</hi> design in his Book against me, seems to be, not so much to convince, as to asperse; nor to edifie, as to vilifie. Therefore I shall only take into a little consideration the first-born of those four Tenents, or <hi>Assertions,</hi> which he stigmatizeth with the odious brands of <hi>heterodox and impious,</hi> and pretends to have collected out my <hi>Pagans debt and dowry:</hi> and so conclude with him; and draw to a conclusion of the Preface it self. The tenor of the said <hi>Assertion,</hi> is this:</p>
            <p rend="indent">
               <hi>That the patience of God leads men to faith in Jesus Christ, whether he be known, or not known to them.</hi> The examination and clearing of this <hi>assertion,</hi> will amount to no less then a confirmation of the main Truth, or Doctrine, avouched in the Discourse; and consequently may be a satisfactory and sufficient Answer to that which Mr. <hi>How</hi> hath written in <hi>opposition.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>How</hi> is not so sacerdotally ingenuous, as it became <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>69</label> him to be, in transcribing and avowing this <hi>assertion,</hi> as mine, being rather a <hi>collection</hi> of his own from my words, then my <hi>assertion.</hi> For my words, to which he relates in forming the <hi>assertion,</hi> are these; <hi>And upon this account the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle clearly implyeth, That the goodness of God leadeth men to repentance,</hi> (Rom. 2.4.) <hi>and consequently (the premisses evincing it) unto Faith in Christ, whether known, or not known, by them.</hi> First, whereas I, from the Apostle affirm, that the <hi>GOOD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NES of God leadeth men to repentance,</hi> he mis-reports me as saying, that the <hi>PATIENCE</hi> of God thus <hi>leads</hi> men. There is a considerable difference between the <hi>Goodness,</hi> and the <hi>Patience,</hi> of God, at least as the one, and the other, may be notioned and apprehended. However, he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to represent mens sayings, or <hi>assertions,</hi> should do it in their own words and expressions. Mens sayings, or <hi>asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> are one thing: and consequents drawn, or pretended to be drawn, from them, are another. Secondly, it is clear from my words, that I do not assert the <hi>assertion</hi> which he chargeth as <hi>heterodox</hi> and <hi>impious,</hi> as of my self, but only
<pb facs="tcp:65873:59"/> lay it down as directly following (in my apprehension) from the words of the Apostle. Wherein if I be mistaken, there can in reason be no harder, or worse, construction put upon it, then this; that I am a man subject to the same infirmity with Mr. <hi>How</hi> himself, who (doubtless) is in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity (though it may be more remote) of mistaking, aswell as I. But whether I be mistaken, or no, in the matter, will come to a tryal presently. But however</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>assertion</hi> in question, in what sense soever it may be called, mine, though it should be yeelded <hi>heterodox</hi> (as in one sense of the word, lately declared, I shall not much gainsay the imputation) yet why it should have that milstone of reproach, <hi>Impious,</hi> tyed about the neck of it, I neither see ground, nor colour. But whether it be either <hi>heterodox</hi> (in Mr. <hi>Hows</hi> intended sense of the word, <hi>i.</hi> that which is contrary to the truth, truly so called) much more <hi>impious,</hi> let the considerations following speak.

            <p n="3">3. When the Apostle turning himself in that context of Scripture consisting of the five first verses, Rom. 2. unto im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and unbelieving men (as the tenor of the context all along makes evident) demands thus of them (though speaking to some one, in the singular number, in the name of them all) vers. 4. <hi>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing the goodness of God leadeth thee unto Repentance?</hi> I would gladly know of Mr. <hi>How,</hi> 1.

I would willingly learn of him, whether there may be a middle, neutral, or indifferent kinde of repentance, which is neither of a saving, nor yet of a sinful or defective, import; and if so, 4.

Now that no <hi>Repentance</hi> without Faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> can be saving, is a Doctrine that lyeth so large and broad in the Scriptures, that I must offer some violence to my thoughts, to think that Mr. <hi>How</hi> himself will deny it. <hi>Whom God hath set forth</hi> (saith the Apostle, speaking of <hi>Christ) to be a propitiation THROƲGH FAITH IN HIS BLOƲD,</hi> &amp;c. (Rom. 3.25.) <hi>But now the righteousness of God without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets; Even the righteousness of God which is by the Faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and ƲPON ALL THAT BELIEVE. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified BY FAITH without the works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 3.21, 22, 28. The Scripture knows no justification, and consequently, no salvation, (at least for persons living to years of discretion) but <hi>by Faith</hi> in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Yea it expresly excludes from
<pb facs="tcp:65873:61"/> salvation, all those that shall not believe.—<hi>but he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> Mark. 16.16.— <hi>but he that believeth not, is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> Joh. 3.18. (To omit other places of like consideration and import, which are, many, and sufficiently known) Therefore though there may be many things besides Faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> of a saving tendency and import, yet there is nothing actually invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men in a state of salvation, much less actually saving, but only in conjunction with Faith in <hi>Christ.</hi> Hence it is that the Apostle joyneth that <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is saving, and unto which remission of sins is promised, with Faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> as the two main subjects of his preaching, Act. 20.21. So they are jointly required by the Lord Christ himself, Mar. 1.15. But that nothing gives a right or title to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, good in Gospel Law, without Faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> will (I presume) be granted by Mr. <hi>Hows</hi> principles themselves without difficulty, or regret. Therefore if <hi>the goodness of God</hi> in his providential dispensations (for that it is this <hi>goodness</hi> of his, of which the Apostle speaks in the text in hand, is both evident in it self, and likewise is the sense general of all Expositors within my reach) <hi>leadeth</hi> men unto such a <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is saving, then must it of necessity lead them unto <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> also, in one sense, or in one kinde, or other.</p>
            <p>Nor can it here reasonably be pretended, that the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>

            <p n="1">1. Evident it is from the tenor of the context all along, that the Apostle in the clause under debate, expostulateth, if not solely, or chiefly, (as some good Expositors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and interpret) with such <hi>Heathens,</hi> yet aswell with these, as with persons of the other character, (which is
<pb facs="tcp:65873:62"/> the sense of the greater part of Expositors) compare vers. 1. with ver. 9. &amp; 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3.

We shall not need (I suppose) to instance upon the account. These texts (with many others of like import) may be perused and considered at leisure, Gen. 20.16. Exod. 21.21. Psal. 18.2. Joh. 4.32, 34. 1 Tim. 5.8. So then, if there be any thing <hi>equivalent</hi> or of a like service or benefit, unto Faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> (strictly and formally so called) whereunto Heathen, or Pagans, may be led or brought by the <hi>goodness of God,</hi> without the explicit knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> this may very tolerably, and without offering any violence or hard measure to the custom of speaking, be termed <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It hath been already sufficiently and substantially proved, even by all kindes of proofs, as by Scripture, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Authority, 1. That the <hi>goodness of God leadeth men unto</hi> such a <hi>repentance,</hi> which is true and saving; 2. That such a <hi>repentance</hi> as this is never found but in conjunction with Faith in <hi>Jesus Christ [viz.</hi> either formally, explicitly, and strictly, or else vertually and equivalently so called.] From hence then it undeniably follows, that the said <hi>Goodness of God,</hi> leading men unto saving <hi>Repentance,</hi> must of necessity lead them unto faith in <hi>Christ</hi> also [either <hi>formally</hi> or <hi>equivalently,</hi> so called] unless it should be supposed that this <hi>Faith</hi> was pre-existent in men before their being <hi>led</hi>

(And lastly) in such a sense, or rather in a sense much nearer hand, and more readily apprehensible, as that wherein the <hi>Rock,</hi> which gave water to the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> (Numb. 20.) was <hi>Christ,</hi> and is so called, [1 Cor. 10.4.] may the <hi>goodness</hi> of God vouchsafed unto Pagans, or those that have never heard of <hi>Christ</hi> by name, be called <hi>Christ,</hi> however the persons we speak of, know it not, cannot call it, by that Name, as neither did the <hi>Israelites</hi> know the <hi>Rock</hi> mentioned, by the name of <hi>Christ.</hi> And in asmuch as that <hi>goodness of God</hi> we speak of, is the fruit or effect of the Great atonement made by <hi>Christ</hi> for mankinde, and <hi>Christ</hi> the means purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or procuring it, it may in such a sense be termed <hi>Christ,</hi> as that wherein the effect is called by the name of the cause producing it, or the thing procured by the name of the means procuring it.

So the deliverance of the Saints from those heavy judgements which shall be executed upon the Beast and his adherents, is termed, their <hi>Patience,</hi> Rev. 14.12. and their <hi>Patience and Faith,</hi> Rev. 13.10. because their <hi>Patience and Faith</hi> were the means by which they obtained this deliverance. So a mans servant under the Law, is termed his <hi>money,</hi> (Exod. 21.21.) because purchased or bought with it (to omit many other the like.)

Tit. 3.8. Rom. 4.5.

Many of the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> believed in God unto justification, and so implicitly believed in <hi>Christ</hi> also; but he was not explicitly, or by name known unto them. So many of them are said to have tempted <hi>Christ</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, 1 Cor. 10.9. who yet never knew <hi>Christ,</hi> nor had ever heard of his Name. See <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place. It seems that the Apostles themselves for a time believed in God only, <hi>viz. explicitly;</hi> and yet were justified by such their believing, Joh. 14.1. And therefore when <hi>Christ</hi> saith unto them, <hi>Believe also in me,</hi> he doth not imply, that they did in no sense or consideration believe in him before, but only that they did not believe in him so explicitly or distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he desired that now, and from henceforth they should.</p>
            <p>The clear result of the particulars briefly touched in this discourse, is</p>
            <p>That this <hi>Assertion, The goodness of God leads men to Faith in Christ, whether known, or not known to them,</hi> being rightly,
<pb facs="tcp:65873:64"/> and according to the sense of the Assertor now explained, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, is neither <hi>heterodox</hi> (the substance and effect of it being <hi>by the best</hi> Protestant writers, yea by the best of Mr. <hi>Hows own side</hi> asserted) much less <hi>impious,</hi> containing nothing in it contrary, either to the Analogy of Faith, or any precept of good manners, or <hi>Christian</hi> conversation, but much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the Grace, Love, and Bountifulness of God towards his Creature, man, and rendring this Creature, in case of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and unthankfulness, inexcuseable. And that which follows from hence, is, 1. that Mr. <hi>How,</hi> reproaching it as <hi>Heterodox</hi> and <hi>Impious,</hi> either speaks evill of what he understands not, or else is a right-down blasphemer of the Truth: and 2. that opposing it, (as he doth in the main body of his discourse, stiled, <hi>The Pagan Preacher silenced</hi>) he stumbleth at the same stone with <hi>Paul</hi> acting in the heat of his <hi>Pharisaism,</hi>

            <p>And now (good Reader) I have done with Mr. <hi>How</hi> also.

And as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esa</hi> cryed out, <hi>Woe is me, for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips;</hi> implying, I conceive, that his daily conversing with people of unworthy language and tongue, wrought a strong jealousie in him, that he had contracted somewhat of the same guilt from them; so I confess I am under no small fears, lest so much traversing and scanning the writings of men of intemperate and unclean pens, as the occasion of my conflicting with so many Adversaries hath drawn me unto, hath taught my pen also many words and sayings of an uncomely character, and such, wherein not being so districtly watchful over my spirit, as I ought, and might have been, I have not so well approved my self unto God, and many good men, as it had been my wisdom to have done. But my God, who hath the greatest reason to be offended at any thing weak, or unworthy in me, I know hath pardoned my over-sights and frailties in this kinde: and good men (I trust) where he hath been gracious, will not be inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. However, for the future, I shall (God willing) keep my self at a due distance from the temptation, and suffer men of unfair and provoking principles, to write their pleasures without answering so much as a word unto them, or once looking upon their nakedness in this kinde. Yet shall I not suffer the cause of God, which I have undertaken, to dye, or sink, under my hand; but whilest God shall please to supply life, and health, with liberty and opportunities otherwise, shall go forward with the second part of my <hi>Redemption Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,</hi> acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:65873:65"/> work. But I nothing doubt, but that God, who would not suffer the life of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> having been miraculously rescued out of the hand of death, to be treacherously destroyed by the chief Priests, though they consulted it (Joh. 12.10.) will likewise stand by those important truths, which, through his Providence and help, have of later years so wonderfully recovered their ancient light and life out of the hand of many great and potent Adversaries and Opposers; and will not suffer them to be again suppressed by any anointing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; but will sooner <hi>of the</hi> very <hi>stones of the earth</hi> raise up men to defend and maintain them, then to suffer them to fall by any conspiracy of men against them. My <hi>Exit</hi> from off the Theatre of this contest, will be (I question not) more then recompensed by the <hi>Intrat</hi> of some other, (one, or more) who will either take the work, where I shall leave it, and carry it an end, or else raise an intire fabrique of their own, more commodious (it may by) for the Truth. But in the work intended, I being only to ingage with the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and the members thereof, I shall meet with no personal invectives, or reflexives; with no wilful (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume) or broad mis-representation of Opinions or Tenents, amongst them: and so shall be free from those temptations of stepping aside into such impertinencies, that are offensive unto many, which ever and anon occur and assault me, when I have to do with the writings of my <hi>English Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now (Reader) I shall out of hand ease thy shoulder from the burthen of a long and wearisome Preface; for which I shall make no other Apology, but that it contains all that I intend at present, or judge necessary, to reply, or give in Answer, to six several Books written against me, two of them in <hi>folio,</hi> and the rest in bulk considerable; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, some other things, the knowledge and consideration whereof, if thou beest a friend, or at least no enemy, to the Truth in the points here briefly touched, will not a little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate thee.) In this respect the prolixity of it cannot reasonably be judged a Delinquent by thee, or suffer in thy
<pb facs="tcp:65873:65"/> thoughts. For though it be a long Preface, yet it is a very short answer to so many such books. I thought to have subjoyned two or three things for thy direction about the Treatise ensuing: but a present period to the Preface may be more material. I am afraid the Press hath not acquitted it self so well to thy contentment, as I could have wished, and have endevoured, though not with success answerable. Yet sometimes a mistake in printing, is beneficent, and an help to memory, especially when remedied by a mans ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> correction; as sometimes a man remembreth his journey the better, and the longer, by the advantage either of a fall received, or of a purse lost, in it.</p>
            <p>Nothing more now, but my earnest prayer to the God of all Grace and Truth, that he will speedily cause these civil wars, about matters of opinion, to cease to the end of <hi>the Common-wealth of Israel,</hi> by bringing forth the truth as it is in <hi>Jesus,</hi> into so perfect and clear a light, that we may on all hands be inabled hereby every man to comprehend his own darkness, and to see the deformity of his own error, and so become willing, yea rejoycingly willing, yea triumphingly willing, to give the right hand of fellowship, every man unto his Brother, in the entertainment of the Truth; that there may be an Heavenly harmony both of judgements, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, throughout the <hi>Christian</hi> world; this (I say) is the prayer of the whole heart and soul, of</p>

Seventhly, That a a man may know that to be which he cannot conceive to be. Eightly, He maintains that, which he doth not say. Ninthly, That God punisheth none but for their sins, and yet punisheth some not for their sins. Tenthly, he complaineth of his Adversary for troubling his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with stale Observations, and yet with Innovations too. Eleventhly, That he is bold and insolent, yet shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much sobrietie in the whole carriage of his business. Twelfthly, That he is a man of parts and learning; and yet not fit to teach boys in a Bell-free. Thirteenthly, That he tels long stories of the infinite love of God to all men; and yet that he teacheth, that he neither loves nor hates them.

In this respect, according to the old advice, <hi>Cum non possis id quod velis, velis id quod possis;</hi> When a man cannot do what he would, it is his best course to be willing to do what he can: I have examined some of the most material passages in the said Books and Writings, by the weaknesses and undue carriages whereof, an estimate may be made without much danger of miscarrying in the account, of the rest of their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65873:73"/> fellows. I have likewise made some little observation by the way, of, and upon that dis-ingenuity and unworthiness of spirit, which utters it self upon all occasions, and sometimes upon no occasion at all, in these Writings. Not that I take any delight, either in seeing my self, or in giving oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity unto others to see, the nakedness of my Brethren, (for I had rather make ten coverings in this kind, then rend or tear one) but that the Truth, the knowledge whereof is of ten thousand times of more concernment unto the world, then the credit or reputation of any men whatsoever, and which could not otherwise be effectually vindicated, might by this means be brought into a clear and perfect light, and prepared for the understandings, judgements, and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men. For if <hi>Aristotle</hi> had good cause to say (as questionless he had) concerning Philosophical truths, which were the commodities he dealt in; that <hi>Amicus Socrates, amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas; Socrates</hi> was his friend, and <hi>Plato</hi> his friend, but Truth was more his Friend, then either: Much more have I reason to say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those important Doctrines and Truths of God, which I hold forth unto the world in my Book of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;</hi> that Mr. <hi>Resburie</hi> is my Friend, Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> my Friend, Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> my Friend; but the meanest of those Truths is a Greater Friend to me then they all.</p>

These (I say) are the Arch-sticklers in those tumultuous contests and oppositions amongst us against the said Doctrine of Redemption: these are they, who as far as is possible, and as lieth in them, will not suffer the people to imbrace the truth in such things which highly concern both their present and future peace, only because themselves (at least as they conceit) are like to be put to rebuke by their imbracing them.</p>

And I have publickly declared and asserted it a practise worthy a <hi>Christian,</hi> whether Minister of the Gospel, or other, not to take from and impair any mans credit or esteem for injuring or endamaging the truth, to any further degree then may well be judged necessary and sufficient for repairing the Truth so injured by him. Most certain it is, that no man can dispute against the Truth <hi>nisi er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando</hi> (as <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh) <hi>i.</hi> but by erring, [or, with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror] For no one Truth whatsoever opposeth another; nor is God divided in himself. Now when the truth is opposed by error, and the entertainment of it in the judgement and consciences of men obstructed by arguments and reasons onely colourable with truth, but not cordiall to it, there is in this case no way to plead the cause of the trurh effectually, or throughly to vindicate the Interest of it, but by detecting the weakness, folly, impertinency, and insufficiency of such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are levied and advanced in opposition to it; and this so plainly, with so much evidence, and (as it were) palp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65873:75"/> insnared by semblances and colours, may be convinced, and brought to see, and acknowledge vanity in them. And I judge, that one main reason why many Books and Discourses, which have been written in the defence of sundry Truths, have not done the service to the World, which they projected and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, (I mean, in convincing the Judgements of men of the Truths contended for) hath been, and is, that they have not brought the weaknesses and absurdities of the adverse Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into as clear &amp; perfect a light; as they might, and ought to have done. For the apprehensions of some are so slow, dull, and heavy; of others, so prejudiced, and prepossest, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one, nor the other are well able to see the vanity or weakness of such Arguments, which magnifie themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Truth, unless they be discovered by an high hand, and presented unto them as in a Vision of the noon-day. And as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Omnes enim trahimur &amp; ducimur ad cognitionis &amp; scientiae cupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, in quâ excellere pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrum putamus.

               <p>ALthough Mr. <hi>Resburies</hi> excess of confidence in the way of his opinions, his insufficiency to give so much as a competent account of any thing held by him, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to me, considered, is to an ingenuous spirit somewhat burthensome, and importune, yet are his frequent incrustations and falsifications of the Opinions of his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, especially being so notorious as some of them are, much more unchristian and intolerable. The great cry and clamour of his black-mouthed Pamphlet is, that either my Preface, which he pretends to examine, or my Book it self, or both, are full of the <hi>two pernicious errors of Socinianisme and Pelagianisme;</hi> whereas he neither yet hath proved, nor ever will be able to prove, that there is the least strain or touch of either of these errors in either. Again, page 21. he shamelesly, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the knowledge of the World, round about him, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>I take liberty to question the Authority of the Scriptures, or whether they be from God, or not, upon supposal of something found in them, or regularly deduced from them, which relisheth not within my reason;</hi> whereas the truth is, that I have said and written, more for the vindication of the Divine Authority the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then I know any ground to believe that himself hath

Probably he may find, where we affirm, that God may perform all the Operations <hi>antecedaneously</hi> used by him for working Conversion [<hi>i.</hi> do all things, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, and which at any time he doth, before conversion be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65873:81"/> actually wrought in any man] and yet conversion so remain in our power, that we may not be converted: and I suppose this is the sense of Mr. <hi>Resburies</hi> Friends, as well as of his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; sure I am, that it would be so, if they quitted themselves like Men. But one of the operations of God which he useth for working conversion, being that which hath an immediate and essential connexion with the effect or work it self of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and upon the exertion or performance of which by God, Conversion is alwayes, and infallibly performed and wrought also, his Adversaries should extreamly forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and become like unto many of his Friends, in weakness of understanding, if that were any Article of their Faith which he (most untruly) fathers upon them. The very next words contain another of the same: <hi>So that all the efficiency they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in converting Grace, is to give a power of conversion, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version it self.</hi> Besides, the untruth of this assertion (in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that utters it) it is little lesse then contradictious in it self: and ascribes that unto Mr. <hi>Re buries</hi> Adversaries, which imports as much as their doing of that, which yet he chargeth them with not doing.

Therefore in this place also Mr. <hi>Resburie</hi> grants and saith, in substance and effect, every whit as much as I ascribe to reason, or the light of nature, in all my Preface. So that I cannot but be very confident, that if he had not been ignorant, either of the sense and import of his own sayings, or of mine, or both, he would never have darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own reputation, as he hath done, by the prodigie of a <hi>Lightless-Starre.</hi>

For be all these things granted, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ich are with more vehemence, then to much purpose (as I conceive) contended for, no man gainsaying them. 1. That the word of God is the only light that we ought to follow in matters of Religion. 2. That the Spirit of God must reveal the sense and mind of God in his word, before men can truly understand it. 3. That the general consent of Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, pious, and learned men in all ages, is an Argument of much weight, to give unto any Doctrine, the credit of truth; let all these (I say) and a thousand like principles more be granted: yet will not this grant evince or prove, but the light of Reason still is (in its kind) and ought to be, the soveraign and supreme guid unto men, in matters of Religion. For why doth any man own and accept the word of God, or that which he believeth to be the word of God, for his guide in matters of Religion? Why doth he not put this honour upon some other word, as the <hi>Turkish Alcoran,</hi> the works of <hi>Aristotle, Plato,</hi> or the like, as well as▪ or rather then, upon the word of God? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, why doth any man subject himself, his judgement, or conscience, to the regulation of the spirit of God, in, or about the understanding of the Scriptures, and not to the guidance, either of his own reason, or of the reason or judgement of some other man? yet again, why doth any man ascribe more to the universall consent of Orthodox, pious &amp; learned men in all ages, for his confirmation, or satisfaction in any point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then he doth to the single judgement, of a simple, weak, and ignorant man? Doth he not all these things by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, guidance, and judgement of his reason? or because his reason dictates, and suggests unto him, that it is much better, and safe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65873:85"/> at the Root and bottom of his Religion, and beareth the weight and whole fabrick of whatsoever he believeth, or acteth regularly, and according to the mind of God herein. Yea, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is nothing else but the regular exercise, or acting of a mans reason about such objects or things, which are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> or commended unto him by God, for such a purpose.</p>
               <p>If it be said, that no mans Reason doth any of these things you speak of, and ascribe to it, unless it be enlightened, moved, and directed by God to do them; I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is most true, that no mans Reason would do as hath been said, unless God should enlighten, move, and direct it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; no more would the Sun shine, unlesse God should enlighten it, and shine with it; or know the times of his going down, and rising, unless God should order his course and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion accordingly. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. As God never fails to enlighten the Sun, but that it may, and doth shine, unless it be by working a miracle; and so to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the course of it, that it still knowes the times of its going down, and rising; so neither doth he ever fail to enlighten, move, and direct the Reasons of men, but that they may teach, and lead them rather to entrust themselves, and their highest concernments with God, or with the word of God, being made known unto them for such, then with the word, or say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of any Creature whatsoever; and so rather to embrace such a sense or interpretation of any part of the word of God, which they know proceeds from the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> then that which they know, or apprehend, to proceed from men. And if any mans reason doth not act according to these principles within him, it is not thorough any defect of illumination, motion, or guidance from <hi>God;</hi> but either out of a carelesness, or neglect to concur with these applications of <hi>God</hi> unto it, or out of a voluntary stubbornness to oppose them. So that when I say, that every mans Reason lieth at the bottom and Root of his Religion, I do not notion Reason abstractedly, or as devested of such a presence or assistance of <hi>God</hi> with it, of which it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>re &amp; actu</hi> devested; but concretely, <hi>i.</hi> as assisted by <hi>God,</hi> with such a presence and concurrence of his with it, which is at no

Nor is it ever the more <hi>Reason,</hi> because it acts, and moves it self irregularly, and irrationally, contrary to the bent &amp; tendency of those impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of that ducture and guidance, which it hath from <hi>God.</hi> For as a wise man▪ (I mean, a man that is habitually wise, that hath a principle or habit of wisdom) may, if he will, do foolishly, and so as either to enetvate, and by degrees to dissolve this principle in him; or however, so as to hurt himself, and to lay his own honour, comforts, and peace in the dust (which was <hi>Solomons</hi> case) in like manner, though <hi>Reason</hi> be through the presence of God with it, habitually, or radically (yea at any time, reducibly) capable of acting, working, and moving, conformably to the will of God, and consistently with the things of a mans own peace; yet this hinders not, but that it may behave it self foolishly also; and so as to lose many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees (at least) of the former presence of God with it; yea, and so, as to lead a man into a snare, and destroy him for ever. So that all the deficiences, and miserable extravagancies of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that either formerly have been, or are at this day to be found amongst men in the world, do at no hand argue or prove, that this faculty (in that concrete signification of the word lately mentioned and explained) was never able to lead them into better, into more honourable or safe wayes but only that it was at liberty, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Nor is it necessary, nor reasonable to expect or require, when a man names <hi>Reason,</hi> simply, and without any mention of that gracious and merciful presence of God with it (lately opened) which is alwayes rich, at, or towards the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, never totally withdrawn, till the last, that he should understand, or mean, <hi>Reason,</hi> in the abstractive sense specified; but as accomodated, and invested by <hi>God,</hi> with that gracious priviledge of his enlightening, assisting, and directing presence

And this notwithstanding, was not ashamed to publish his Sermon unto the world, under the Title of, <hi>A Vindication of free Grace;</hi> much after such a manner, as <hi>Squire</hi> the Traitor in Queen <hi>lizabeths</hi> dayes, acted his part, who clapping poyson on her Saddle to destroy her, yet was

               <p>First administer to their Reader, the Antidote of my Grounds and Reasons, for the truth of what I hold and affirm; and then deliver their own poyson, without much danger to him that drinks it, afterwards. For as there was no great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of any mans being stung or hurt, by the Rods of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65873:89"/> though turned into Serpents, whilst <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod was present to devoure them; So neither is there much cause of fear, that men should suffer any pollution of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the shadowy washy arguings of men, on the behalf of error, whilst clear and solid Arguments, such as are preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly demonstrative of the Truth, lie before them. Nor do I make much question, but that those Transcriptions out of my Book, which both <hi>Mr. Resburie</hi> and <hi>Mr. Kendall,</hi> have inserted in theirs, especially in conjunction with what they offer in way of answer to them, will turn to a good account for the advancement of those Truths, which they oppose. For many (I presume) who either disdained, or were really and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scienciously afraid, to take any of my Books, or Writings into their hand to read, will be inclinable enough to read any thing which shall come in the name of these men unto them. Onely <hi>Mr. Kendall</hi> sometimes mangleth, misfigures and defaceth the context, on which he comments, by transcribing it brokenly, and by peece-meals, and many times omitting▪ if not dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, that which is most material. Nor are his Printers (for there is, or was, it seems, a Trium-virate of these also) so inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from offending in the <hi>black letters,</hi> (as <hi>Mr. Kendall</hi> calls them, and which he informs his Reader, <hi>come out of Coleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street</hi>) more then in the <hi>white,</hi> (for such, by the rule of opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, must be the Characters that come from <hi>Bresland,</hi> near <hi>Bodmin</hi> in <hi>Cornwall;</hi>) but that I have as much occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their unfaithfulness, as he; unless he himself will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take the shame of the miscarriages here, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that (for the most part) he may without wronging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>But to return to Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> (reserving for Mr. <hi>Kendall,</hi> his own place) and to give the Reader a brief taste only of the strength and substance of his Sermon, in two or three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; and withall of his insufficiency to mannage the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, therein undertaken. Pag. 2. To prove that <hi>Election is of persons</hi> [personally considered; for these words he should have added to state my Opinion, which he pretends to cite and confute] <hi>and not of kinds; of individuals, not of species,</hi> he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65873:89"/> from <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. that <hi>we are said to be chosen before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World.</hi> Where 1. the Apostle doth not say, that <hi>we</hi> are, or were chosen; if by <hi>we, Mr. Pawson</hi> means himself, and all or any part of his Auditors; but speaking of himself, and those <hi>Ephesians,</hi> who now believed, he saith, <hi>According as God hath chosen us in him, before the foundation of the World.</hi> Nor will <hi>Mr. Pawson</hi> himself (I presume) own it for his sense, that all his Auditory, or any determinate part of them, were <hi>elected before the foundation, &amp;c.</hi> However, whether this be his censure, or no, most certain it is, that the Apostle affirms no such thing in that place. 2. He cites the Scripture fraudulently, leaving out those words, in him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which directly overthrow that conceit, which he buildeth on it; much after the manner of him, who citing Scripture to serve a wicked turn, left out these words, <hi>to keep thee in all thy wayes</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">See Mat. <hi>4.6.</hi> compared with Psal. <hi>91.</hi>
                  </note> because, their face was set against such a service. For in the very same discourse, from which he citeth my Opinion against personal Election, (as it is commonly understood) I clearly prove, that God is said to have chosen <hi>Paul,</hi> and the rest of the believing <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> Nor doth <hi>Mr. Pawson</hi> offer any thing at all to disable my proof in this behalf: nor is he able (I am very well assured) to offer any thing material this way.</p>

               <p>WHereas (p. 2.) Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> pointeth at me in his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, as if I affirmed, that <hi>Election is only the standing <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>1</label> good pleasure and purpose of God, to give life unto those that believe,</hi> it plainly sheweth, either that Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not my Opinion about Election; or, in case he doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, that he is not so tender of falsifications, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a Servant and Minister of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to be. I indeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, (in the place pointed at by him) that that Act of God mentioned, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4. where he is said to have <hi>chosen Paul,</hi> and <hi>the believing Ephesians before the foundation of the World</hi> (as was lately said) imports no other act in God, but only the standing counsel and good pleasure, which is eternal in him, of giving life and salvation to all those who believe in <hi>Christ;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> might have pleased to understand, that by the act of <hi>chusing</hi> (ascribed unto God there) I do not understand the act of his <hi>electing</hi> or <hi>chusing,</hi> but the act of his decreeing to elect, or chuse; for I plainly enough declare my mind and sense in in this, page 461. 462. (of which more ere long.) So that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65873:90"/> whereas he adds, that <hi>Election alwayes carries salvation along with it,</hi> as a thing denied or opposed by me, the truth is, that herein he both abuseth me, and deludeth his Auditory. I no where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that <hi>Election alwayes carrieth Salvation along with it;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I deny that Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> is able to prove it, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. which he alledgeth upon the account. For I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where evidently proved, that the face of this Scripture is set another way.<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Redemption Redeemed. pag.</hi> 207, 208, 209, &amp;c.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after he saith; <hi>notwithstanding such a purpose, to save who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> believes, all might perish,—and Christ be an head, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Body, a King without Subjects. Quorsum haec?</hi> or how little edification is there in these sayings? Or what opposition to any thing of mine? If I should say, notwithstanding a purpose in God, to save <hi>Abraham,</hi> all other men but he <hi>might perish;</hi> notwithstanding Gods institution of circumcision, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his appointment of a day of judgement, with twenty the like, <hi>all might perish:</hi> what sap or savour is there in such sayings as these? And what if <hi>all might perish, notwithstanding such a purpose in God,</hi> as he speaks of? what inconvenience, or absurdity is there in this, either in reference unto God or men? As for God, the Apostle plainly affirms, that He (with the rest of the Apostles, and faithful Ministers of the Gospel) <hi>was unto God a sweet Savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish.</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15.</note> So that if <hi>all might have perished,</hi> yea if <hi>all</hi> had <hi>perished,</hi> God had sustained no losse: his <hi>Christ,</hi> and his gracious tender of him to the world, would have been the same <hi>sweet Savour</hi> unto him. Nor is it, or would it have been any inconvenience unto men, that <hi>all might perish,</hi> it being supposed and granted withall, that all likewise might be saved. Salvation is never the lesse benefit or blessing unto men, being obtained, because sometimes there was a possibility of their non-obtaining it; but rather, so much the greater. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity, or inconvenience (especially in reference unto men) would be ten thousand times greater, in case Mr. <hi>Pawsons</hi> imagination were the truth; <hi>viz.</hi> that God hath made fast the Gates of Salvation with the Iron Barre of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and irreversible Decree of Reprobation, against incomparably the farre greatest p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt of men; so that there
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65873:91"/> never was, nor could be, any possibility for them to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Those expressions likewise, <hi>Christ might be an Head without a Body, a King without Subjects,</hi> &amp;c. which are offered under a pretence of high absurdities, in case they were truths, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, but what even a Child might readily vindicate from such an imputation. For what absurdity, or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is it, that <hi>Christ</hi> should be an <hi>Head actu signato, i.</hi> a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son fit or meet to make an Head, and not be an Head, <hi>actu ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercito, i.</hi> not an head actually united to a Body? There is the same reason of his being a <hi>King</hi> also. When <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, that he had <hi>seen Princes walking as Servants on the Earth,</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11.7.</note> he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it no absurdity to stile those <hi>Princes,</hi> who had no subjects, nor any thing else, externally comporting with the State of a Prince; but ascribes unto them the Honour of this denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon the account of their truly noble, and Prince-like qualities, and endowments. But besides the regularness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensiveness of such consequences in case they were regularly deducible from their premises, the clear truth is, that they are plain <hi>non-sequiturs.</hi> It doth not follow, that if all men might perish, yea or should perish, that <hi>Christ should be an Head without a Body, or a King without Subjects.</hi> For might he not, yea should he not, have been an Head to a Body of Angels, whether men had been any part of this Body, or no? Are not Angels also now his Subjects? If it were lawful for him, that is Orthodox, to learn any thing from a man that is erroneous, Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> might have informed himself of these things, from p. 438, 439. &amp;c. as also from pag. 215, 216. of my Book of Redemption. But there is nothing more usual with men of Mr. <hi>Pawsons</hi> judgement, in the controversies before us, then with much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, seriousness, and gravity, to make terriculaments and Bug-bears, of such sayings and notions which have nothing but soberness and truth in them.

But that Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> should not apprehend and see a plain and perfect consistency, and no opposition at all, between being <hi>justified by our believing in Christ,</hi> and <hi>by our Christ believed on,</hi> is not a little strange. The Scripture affirms both the one and the other, and both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently; and yet (I trust Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> will acknowledge) without any opposition or contradiction to it self. Yet of the two, if places of both expressions were diligently drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and compared, I believe that justification is ten times oftner ascribed unto Faith, or believing in <hi>Christ,</hi> then unto <hi>Christ</hi> believed on. In which respect Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> doth not shew himself a very good friend to the Scriprures, in rejecting and disannulling the more frequent, plain, and lightsome expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65873:93"/> thereof, only to establish and make way for those that are more unusual, and involved.</p>

And I cannot but (by the way, and upon this occasion) make this sad observation concerning <hi>Mr. Pawson,</hi> and many others of his Opinion, in these <hi>Dort</hi> controversies; that if there be a corrupt or by-sense, that can with any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable colour or pretence, be put upon a Scripture terme or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in any Text relating unto them, this sense is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up and contended for, by these men. But that by the word, <hi>Elected,</hi> or <hi>chosen</hi> (in the Scripture last mentioned) is not meant the act, or execution, but the Decree of Election, might have been within the Sphere of <hi>M. Pawsons</hi> knowledge before this, if he could have but subscribed this Principle,

               <p>For pag. 462. of Red.

If he intends to hold forth a possibility in this kind <hi>unto every one,</hi> doth he not hereby sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that <hi>Christ</hi> died <hi>for every one?</hi> or doth he suppose a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that any man may be saved, for whom <hi>Christ</hi> died not?

However, Ingenuity should be a religious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of words, in quotations. But 2. Whereas he saith, <hi>that this doth not make Grace to difference one man from another;</hi> if by <hi>Grace,</hi> he means the first Grace, or common Grace, usually by Divines called, <hi>preventing Grace,</hi> that which he saith, is true (in a sense.) But neither doth himself (I presume) nor his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates, hold that this Grace makes one man to differ from another.</p>
               <p>Now it is as clear as the Sun. 1. that this Grace is as free, if not more free, as any other. 2. That this is the Grace meant
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65873:97"/> by me, in the place pointed at by him, and unto which I ascribe the healing of the natural condition of man. Therefore in saying, that I do <hi>not make Grace to difference one man from another,</hi> if he speaks it of me, as dissenting from him and his in it, (and upon what other account he should speak it, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not:) he speaks as a man ignorant, or forgetful, of his own Opinion. If, when he saith, <hi>this doth not make Grace to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, &amp;c.</hi> by <hi>This,</hi> he meaneth, that my saying of that which he reports, doth it not, I confess this is a truth; but of so mean and contemptible a strain, that twice two makes four, may compare in weight with it.</p>
               <p>But to speak to the heart of Mr. <hi>Pawsons</hi> notion or conceit <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>3</label> about <hi>differencing Grace,</hi> (at least if it be uniform and consistent with it self, and not desultory, confused, and uncertain, as by severall expressions I meet with in the last page of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, it seems to be.) If by <hi>differencing Grace,</hi> he means that which maketh one man to differ from another <hi>formally,</hi> (as whiteness in a Wall, makes this Wall being white, to differ from another which is black) so his description of it (only the words he useth, rightly understood, because they are not so proper) may stand. <hi>Differencing Grace</hi> (saith he) <hi>is an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Seed, put into some, not others, whereby they are made new Creatures; a divine spiritual principle, &amp;c.</hi> But this is not that <hi>Differencing Grace,</hi> about which the main contest lieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, and his opposers: his mistake is great in his own affaires, if he so judgeth. For that <hi>Differencing Grace,</hi> which occasioneth so much <hi>difference</hi> in judgement between him, and others, is that <hi>Grace,</hi> which <hi>differenceth</hi> one man from another, by way of efficiency. Nor is the difference much (if any thing at all) between him and others, about this kind of <hi>Grace,</hi> in respect of the ultimate act, or efficiency of it neither (that I mean, by which that other Grace which differenceth one man from another <hi>formally,</hi> as a believer from an unbeliever, is actually wrought) but in respect of those former acts, or workings of it, such as are intermedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te exerted by God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the first act of Grace, wherewith the Creature (general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) is prevented, and the last or consummating act of this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65873:98"/> Grace, whereby the Creature is actually made <hi>a new Creature,</hi> and (as the Scripture speaketh) translated from death unto life. For 1. Mr. <hi>Pawson,</hi> (I suppose, as hath been already said) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with his adversaries about <hi>preventing Grace,</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> that this doth not <hi>difference one man from another,</hi> either <hi>formally,</hi> or efficiently, or so that any man becomes regenerate herewith. And 2. His Adversaries (I presume) agree with him about the last act of Grace, that which hath an immediate, essential, and inseparable connexion with that change, or new impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon the soul, which maketh one man to differ from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>formally;</hi> as <hi>viz.</hi> that this is in-frustrable, and such which cannot now be defeated, or prevented in its intended effect, by men. So that the quick of the difference or Question, between him, and those of opposite judgement to him, about <hi>differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Grace,</hi> resteth in these two things. 1. Whether amongst all those acts, or workings of the Grace of <hi>God</hi> upon men, which interveen, or are exerted by him, between the first act thereof, and the last, there be any, one, or more, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted, or acted by him upon such terms of irresistibility; but that the person, in, and upon, whom they are exerted, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may notwithstanding so behave or demean himself, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be actually converted, or brought savingly to believe. 2. Whether the first Grace of <hi>God</hi> vouchsafed unto men, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Grace, may not by means of the very native genius, and aiding property of it, be so comported with by men, as to be graciously rewarded, and seconded by <hi>God,</hi> with subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Grace,</hi> or a further measure or degree of <hi>Grace;</hi> and this a gain so comported with likeness, as to be rewarded by <hi>God</hi> with that <hi>Grace,</hi> or such an act of <hi>Grace,</hi> which shall <hi>difference</hi> him in point of Faith, or Regeneration, from all unregenerate persons, and unbelievers in the World. Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> (it seems) holds the negative, his Opponents the affirmative, in both these Questions. But the truth is, that in all his Discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Grace,</hi> and differencing <hi>Grace</hi> (as he calls it) he is so confused, intricate, and intangled, that no man can, with any clearness of satisfaction, tell either what he would have, or what he opposeth. Only this is evident, that he speaketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, (at least in this quarter of his discourse) unless it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65873:98"/> be in a mystery and in the dark, to either of the Questions mentioned, in opposition to the sense of his Adversaries. And yet I believe withall, that he hath said as much in this kind, as either himself, or any of his Friends, can say to any purpose, as well the Scriptures, as the principles of reason, lying so fair and large as they do, for his adversaries.</p>
               <p>Again p. 24. He tells us, That <hi>we are not to attribute the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencing <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> of us to any thing of our selves, but, &amp;c.</hi> and yet he had said (a very few lines before) <hi>that it is not God, nor the Grace of God, but man, who believes,—having his own natural faculties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in them.</hi> Surely these sayings <hi>knock the one against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and they had need know how to make the <hi>East</hi> and the <hi>West</hi> meet, who shall undertake to make peace between them. For are not a mans natural faculties his own? and when they are <hi>ingaged</hi> in believing, are they not engaged by or with his own will, and free consent? And doth not such an <hi>engagement</hi> as this, and a will or consent thus to <hi>engage,</hi> yea doth not the very act of believing it self, which Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> himself grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be <hi>mans act,</hi> and <hi>not Gods;</hi> do not (I say) all these things <hi>difference</hi> those in whom they are found? Or is it Mr. <hi>Pawsons</hi> sense, that they who believe not, are equal unto, or the same in their spiritual estates, with those who do believe? If this be not his sense, why doth he misinform his hearers, by teaching them, that <hi>we are not to attribute the differencing of us to any thing of our selves?</hi> Or what would he have them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by these words, <hi>of our selves?</hi> For to tell them, <hi>but yet man doth not put forth those spiritual acts by his own natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as natural, but as spiritually enabled by this supervenient Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace,</hi> is not to assert any thing in opposition to the judgement or sense of his opposers, though he would fain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate such a thing into his hearers, that they may be brought to look upon his opposers, as weak and erroneous men, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself, as some great <hi>Theopompus</hi> to confute them.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any thing more then a meer vapour in these <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> words (presently following.) <hi>But all the wit of man cannot avoid it, but that we may glory in our selves, if there be not such a peculiar
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65873:99"/> differencing Grace.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Pawson,</hi> or any other man be resolved to <hi>glory in themselves,</hi> whether they have any just ground or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion so to do, or no, it is like that <hi>all the wit of man cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it,</hi> or prevent their doing it, whether there be such a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing Grace, or no, as he speaks of. But if men have received that Grace from another, and particularly from God, by means of which they become <hi>differenced</hi> from others, they have no reasonable or just cause of <hi>boasting,</hi> whether they <hi>boast,</hi> or no. This is the Apostles express Doctrine:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</note>
                  <hi>Now if thou didst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implying, that no man hath any just occasion of boasting, but only of that, or for that, which he hath not received [meaning of Grace, and meer good will] from another. For though a man hath received something from another, yet in case he hath received it upon termes of a just claim, and as merited by him, he may very reasonably, and lawfully <hi>boast</hi> of it, if the nature, value, or worth of the thing otherwise, will reasonably bear such a deportment, or expression of a mans self, as <hi>boasting</hi> is; because, in this case, though in a natural consideration, a man receives the thing from another, yet receiving it upon his own accompt, in a moral consideration, he receives it rather from himself, his own labor, worth, or goodness, then from another. The Labourer is more beholding to himself, and his Labor for his wages, or Hire, then to him that set him on work, and payeth it unto him. So then it being the clear, constant, and upon all occasions, the plainly declared sense of Mr. <hi>Pawsons</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, 1. That whatsoever they have, they receive from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <hi>viz.</hi> God. 2. That whatsoever they receive from God, they receive it in a way of Grace, undeserved favour and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not upon any account of merit, or desert in themselves, from hence it roundly, and with pregnancy of consequence, followes, that their Opinion about the efficacy of the Grace of God, and power of the Creature man, ministreth no reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable or just occasion in the least, of <hi>boasting</hi> in, or of himself, unto any man. Therefore for any man, either to stingle, or declaim against it, as if it were tardy, or reproveable in the least in this kind, cannot by charity her self be drawn to any
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65873:99"/> milder interpretation, then either of grosse ignorance, or disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity in the highest.</p>
               <p>But though Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> had miscarried (as we see he hath <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> done ten times over) in the former Acts, or parts of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yet he should have taken better heed of stumbling at that stone, which they call, <hi>in extremo actu deficere.</hi> For towards the very close of all, doth he not thus bespeak his Auditors? <hi>Take heed of crying down the Doctrine of peculiar free Grace, as harsh; for to the people of God, none more sweet.</hi> Doth he devest all those to whom his <hi>Doctrine of free Grace,</hi> is not as <hi>sweet</hi> as any other, of the high and blessed priviledge <hi>of being the people of God,</hi> to inrich himself, and his Friends only, with the spoyl? Indeed by some lines soon after following, he seems to imply, that had the love of <hi>God</hi> towards him been every whit as rich and great, as now it is, yet unless it had been, or should be, as pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and particular also, as now he conceiveth it to be, it would have been but of an ordinary, or far lesse precious resentment with him; as if he, and they, had been tempted into their unworthy Opinion, touching the narrowness of the breast of <hi>God,</hi> towards men, by the unclean spirit of some such princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or disposition, working in them, as this, <hi>viz.</hi> That no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or single person, can with any strength, or signalness of affection, love or honour him, that is a publick benefactor, no not though himself should partake as richly of his benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence as any others. And I verily believe, that that ignoble and degenerous strain of self-love, in conjunction with that Bird of the same feather, a neglect of the peace, welfare, and prosperity of others, which raign, or rather tyrannize as they do, in the hearts and minds of the generality of men, have been a snare unto many, and occasioned them to change the glory of the love of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> which the Scripture magnifies, as commensurable with the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his posterity, into the similitude of the creeping affections of a self-seeking, or self-pleasing earthly Prince, towards two or three favourites, or Houshold Servants. Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> (it seems) could see this beam in the eye of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but could not pluck it out of his own. <hi>The Jewes</hi> (he tells us p. 11.) <hi>generally run upon this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65873:100"/> mistake, that the Messiah, and salvation by him, belonged onely to themselves.</hi> And doth not Mr. <hi>Pawson,</hi> and those who dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with him, <hi>run</hi> every whit as fast as they, upon the like <hi>mistake?</hi> Do not they instead of <hi>Gods</hi> thousand, take their Tables, and write ten? instead of his World, write their hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, making themselves these ten, and this handful? And when they have done thus, set up this Trophie, <hi>Universal Redemption is not Redeemed, but must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding all the wit and language that is laid down and sacrificed for the saving of it.</hi> p. 10. Yes (Mr. <hi>Pawson) Universal Redemption is redeemed:</hi> it is you and your Tribe that are yet in bondage, to the contrary error; and therefore you cannot hear the Scriptures <hi>speaking home to the proof of it,</hi> though they speak never so loud, and plainly. <hi>He that hath drunk old Wine, will not presently drink new; for he saith, the old is better.</hi> I can with patience and hope, wait for Mr. <hi>Pawsons</hi> submission to the truth; wherein many have prevented him, who were every whit as far behind as he. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> will give me leave to be his Interpreter, I shall very gladly joyn with him in his admonition, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation unto men. <hi>Take heed of crying down the Doctrine of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar free Grace, as harsh; for to the people of God</hi> (at least to many of them) <hi>none more sweet.</hi> But I know no man, whom it more concerns to hearken to the voyce of this exhortation then himself. For that which he calls the <hi>Doctrine of free Grace,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly interpreted, amounts to as much as a <hi>crying down of the Doctrine of free Grace</hi> indeed. That <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> which the Scriptures so highly magnifie, and commend unto the World, renders men capable of such wayes and works, which are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewardable by him, and which rendreth all those that obey the docture and motions of it, meet for salvation and eternal happiness. Whereas that which Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> holds forth in the name of <hi>Free grace,</hi> renders him that should receive it, uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that <hi>great recompence of reward,</hi> of which the Gospel speaketh; and therefore upon a true account is no grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. For doth not Mr. <hi>Pawsons free grace</hi> necessitate all those who receive it, unto Faith, Repentance, and all other good works, that are produced and wrought by it? And have I not demonstratively proved else-where, (as <hi>viz.</hi> p. 319, 320. 341.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65873:100"/> &amp;c. of my Book of <hi>Redemption,</hi> see also <hi>The Agreement and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Brethren,</hi> p. 55. &amp; 75. to the same account) that all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated actions and works are unrewardable?</p>
               <p>To prove that <hi>Christ by his death purchased Faith for all those whom he intended to redeem,</hi> how palpably doth he misuse the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles words, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to beleeve on him, but also to suffer for his sake,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting upon, <gap reason="foreign">

Here Mr. <hi>Pawson</hi> is content to drink new Wine, though the old was much better, the new (indeed) being stark naught. And I cannot but take and give notice here by the way, that in citing the Scriptures themselves, he steeres no better course of faithfulness, than he doth in citing my writings: For thus he cites the former part of the said verse, (suppressing wholly the latter, which, if present, would have checked the error of his interpretation) <hi>Unto you it is given on the behalf of Christ, to beleeve, &amp;c.</hi> whereas the words run thus, <hi>for unto you it is given not only to beleeve on him;</hi> and why he left out these words, <hi>not only,</hi> his conscience best knoweth; though otherwise the matter is of ready conjecture: nor is it denyed, but that every good thing; and consequently, beleeving, <hi>viz.</hi> in the cause and means of it, and consequently, in the act it self, when any man doth beleeve, is vouchsafed by God unto men for Christs sake.</p>

Amongst many ends &amp; shreds of Poetry scattered up and down the face of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Book, there is one (as far as yet I have observed, and remember) wanting; the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration whereof would have done him better service, than all those imployed by him.

They return him an answer after his own heart; declaring, that they saw (as in

The best I can make of their design, in making such a nest for M. <hi>Kendall</hi> &amp; his Book, amongst the Stars, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> To put him upon the utmost contention and highest straining of his wits and learning, in the Composure of his Book, that if possible, he and it might together get up into it.

Or why do his three Friends rejoyce over him, as one triumphing so gloriously over those, who never opposed him, or lift up a Weapon of Warre against that Faith, of which they make him so zealous and puissant a Defender? For I am securely assured, that there is neither syllable, letter, or tittle, neither chapter, page, or period, in my Book of Redemption, which either denieth, or under-speaketh, the <hi>Vortcordian</hi> Grace of God; much lesse which opposeth the <hi>merit of the death of Christ,</hi> nor yet which symbolizeth with the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie, rush or branch (as hath been said, and shewed formerly,) When <hi>the day shall declare, and the fire try every mans work, of what sort it is,</hi> they will be found injurious to the Grace of God, who shall upon such termes, represent and teach it unto the World, as if no person whatsoever could or should ever be made happy or blessed by it: and they opposers of the merit of the death of Christ, who teach, that it extendeth to the impetration of Redemption for a few only; and they <hi>Pelagianizers,</hi> who teach, that Christ died not for all men.

But (as it appears in his second Epistle) he hopes to make Doctor <hi>Whichcote,</hi> with the rest of his Cousins, the Children of his Aunt <hi>Cambridge,</hi> his Spaniels to pull this Chesnut out of the fire. Only he informs them of a ready and easie way, how to do it. This nineteenth Chapter (saith he) is answered in brief: <hi>una litura potest,</hi> blot it all out, and then 'tis answered. A worthy method, and direction for them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who shall have a mind, and yet want time to answer his Book. And the truth is, that Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> (pon the matter) hath himself followed this method in all that he hath yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered unto my Book: he hath mangled, defaced, scratched, and blotted all he hath medled with in it; and this is the strength of his Answers. Yet in this (haply) he speaks truth (though little to his honour) <hi>I have shewed it to be needless, that even I should meddle too much with it.</hi> For the truth is, that no mans impossibilities are his necessities, or concernments; and therefore <hi>Mr. Kendall</hi> may very possibly have <hi>shewed,</hi> that it is <hi>needless</hi> for him to answer <hi>much,</hi> yea, or any thing at all to that Chapter, it being impossible for him to answer any thing at all unto it (worthy the name of an Answer) unless he could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove that the Authors there produced, never wrote what they did write, or at least never wrote that, which is on all hands published under their Names; or else, that all the <hi>Greek</hi> Lexicons, and <hi>Latine</hi> Dictionaries, now extant and in use amongst us, have abused our understandings, in the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and sense of words assigned by them, and given us <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> Saw for Hatchet, and Hatchet for Saw, Horse for House, and House for Horse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And besides, how unsavoury and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clerk-like is it to inform such a person of worth, as Doctor <hi>Whichcote</hi> is, together with an whole University of learned men, that he <hi>hath shewed it to be needless,</hi> that he <hi>should meddle too much with any one thing;</hi> as if there were some other thing, one, or more, with which it were <hi>needful</hi> for him <hi>to meddle too much.</hi>

There was a notable Impostor, who bare certain Noble-men in hand, that he had beautified their Church, or Temple, with very curious and rare pictures; and these so conditioned, that none could see any thing of them, but only those that were legitimate, and begotten in lawful Marriage. The Noble-men, because they would not incur the dis-repute of being counted base-born, all professed and said, that they very well saw the said painting. <hi>Mr. Kendall</hi> seeks to conjure all his Readers into an approbation of his Book,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65873:108"/> by informing them, that his notions and expressions (at least many of them) are of such a calculation, and frame, that none but regenerate men can approve, or consent unto them: and consequently, that all those, who shall stumble, or take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at them, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> give sentence against themselves, that they are persons unregenerate, and strangers unto God, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Counsels, and wayes. In this point <hi>Mr. Kendall</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like unto the Emperor <hi>Caligula,</hi> who (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth of him) handled many most cruelly, and cut some in the middle with a Saw, for no great matters of Offence, <hi>sed male de munere suo opinantes, vel quod nunquam per Genium suum deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassent,</hi> that is, but because they had no good Opinion of his [publique] gift [bestowed on the people in some play, or game] or else because they had never sworn by his Genius. I know not how to help it: I must incur the severe penalty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by this Sage Lawgiver, and be content to lie under the disparagement of being thought an unregenerate man (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, according to his principles, I know no shame or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement belonging to unregeneracy in men, more than unto the want of the wings of a Bird to flie in the Aire,

But if they will please to acquaint themselves with the Opinions of his Adversaries, from their own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and compare them with his, they will plainly find that in far the greatest part of his Book, he fighteth not more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst false, then forged Opinions, and that his Adversaries (so called) are his friends and fellows in very many points and passages, wherein he would fain have his Readers believe, that he playes the man against them.

                  </note> By that misrepresentation of the words menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, the poor man hath intangled himself with this <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, viz.</hi> to acknowledge, either that my Arguments are <hi>good,</hi> or that his report of my words is stark naught.

I might justly arraign him at the same Barre, for charging me (immediately after the words of the former untruth) with saying, that <hi>the Assembly at Westminster did but cast up an hedge about the field, while the Cattel were eating the Corn.</hi> The phrase of <hi>casting up an hedge,</hi> my Rhetorique, such as it is, knoweth not; but Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> gave me a hint very lately, whereby I might understand, with what kind of Weapon I should be beaten, <hi>viz.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> this charge against his Adversaries, will thoroughly appear by comparing briefly their sense and opinion about the <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> he speaks of, with his own. <hi>We</hi> (saith he, to his Mother <hi>Oxford) do not say, that God ever useth the</hi> Prerogative, <hi>or right of his Soveraign Dominion, in any distributing of rewards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ne{que} enim as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serimus Deum unquam jure hoc supremi do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minii usum, in praemiis suis dimetiendis, paenis{que} morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium cuiquam pro arbitrio, sed in una gratia quibus velit benigene impertienda, quibus non velit, non inique deneganda.</note>
                  <hi>or pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishments, to any person of mankind, but only in his kind bestowing Grace on whom he will, and in denying it without injustice unto those, on whom he will not.</hi> And again (in his Request to his Reader, p. 1.) <hi>And yet we say not, that God exerciseth his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in any thing but this, that he gives or denies grace as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, &amp;c.</hi> So that we see, that he and his party circumscribe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65873:113"/> and bound the Divine Prerogative, at least the exercise of it, with the line of giving, and denying Grace, to whom, and as he pleaseth. Now (Reader) judge between this man, and his adversaries, in the case of the charge before thee: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he stateth, or placeth the Prerogative of God, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extent of the exercise of it, thou hast heard: Take now the sense of his Adversaries in the point. First, they hold and maintain, as fully, as plainly, and with as little regret, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that God doth bestow Grace on whom, and as, or upon what terms, he will, or pleaseth, and again, that he denieth it to whom, &amp; as, or upon what termes he will. Nor can he find any thing in my Writings, which fairly construed, hath the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy hereunto. Only M. <hi>Kendall</hi> (I suppose) notioneth the will of God, about the point in hand, in one kind, and his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries in another: He looketh on the will of God in the busines, as acting, or exerting it self without <hi>Counsel;</hi> that is, as moving, or acting by no determinate principles, or rules, as of wisdom, justice, equity, or the like, which are in the least degree, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scriptures; whereas his adversaries conceive, and that by warrant of the Scriptures, which teach them, that God <hi>worketh all things,</hi> not simply, or meerly according to his will, but <hi>according to the counsel of his will,</hi> that the <hi>will</hi> of God, by, and according unto which, he both giveth and denyeth Grace, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it self herein in full comportance, with his wisdom, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, justice, equity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, by Rules or Principles cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responding with these glorious Attributes, and which are in part, and in the general, revealed and made known unto men, in the Scriptures. But they are as far from touching the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, or the liberty of the <hi>will</hi> of God, in giving, or deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace unto whom he will, with the least of their fingers, as himself: yea, they judge it a far more sacred Prerogative, and more worthy God, <hi>to work all things,</hi> &amp; so to be at liberty, to <hi>work all things;</hi> (and consequently, to give, and deny Grace) <hi>according to the counsel of his will</hi> (in the sense declared) then it would be, to be at liberty to <hi>work all things according to his will,</hi> without <hi>counsel</hi> (in such a sense.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> imprisoneth the Prerogative of God, and the exercise of it, within the narrow bounds of <hi>giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65873:113"/> and denying Grace to whom he will,</hi> his Adversaries extend and inlarge it in the exercise of it, not unto this only, but unto many other dispensations; yea, and particularly unto those of rewarding, and punishing men, wherein Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> expresly denieth it. For they do not conceive or judge, but that God exerciseth every whit as much Prerogative, in rewarding his Saints, and Beleevers, with that immense surplussage of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, so far above all imaginable worth, or desert of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, as he doth <hi>in giving Grace to whom he will;</hi> yea, and on the other hand, in punishing wicked and impenitent persons also; especially if Mr. <hi>Kendalls</hi> Doctrine (wherein I shall not oppose him) be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that God <hi>is so gracious a Lord, that he ever makes the wickedest of men some considerable abatements of their deserved measure.</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Epistle to Doctor <hi>Which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote,</hi> &amp;c.</note> But the truth is, that if we consult narrowly with the Scriptures, we shall find that they insist not upon, urge not, plead not the cause of the Prerogative of God, in any of his wayes or dispensations, more then, or indeed so much as, in the business of justification; whereof some account is given in my Exposition of the ninth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> not long since published. By the way, hath not Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> dashed his foot sorely against the stone of false accusing, in charging his Adversaries (and this ten times over) with dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, impairing, or denying the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of God; when as they assert it with every whit as much zeal and faithfulness, yea, upon far more ample, and large termes, than himself; yea, and in that very particular it self, wherein alone himself, and his (as it seems) place the exercise of it?</p>

               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> trades in this black commodity, <hi>ab ovo ad mala,</hi> from his Eggs to his Apples: <hi>Ergo.</hi> How untrue all the 4. particulars now mentioned, are, his own Conscience, were it not brib'd and blinded with prejudice and partiality, would readily enough inform him. For 1. Doth he, that seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously desires and intreats men of worth and learning, to declare their judgements in any weighty point, in matters of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, <hi>provoke</hi> them with any <hi>contumelious importunity?</hi> 2. Concerning his <hi>Westminster Council,</hi> over the reputation whereof, (the better to insinuate with the members, who are like to be <hi>Pars magna,</hi> a considerable part of those, that must put honour upon that, which wanteth, in his Book) he maketh himself so jealous: my <hi>head</hi> is not conscious to any such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of my <hi>feet</hi> towards it, as he suggesteth. If he desires to escape branding, let him produce his witnesses. 3. For the <hi>prime Divines, Expositors &amp; Annotators,</hi> he speaks of, when he chargeth me with the incivility of a <hi>loathsom spitting</hi> on them, I know not what he meanes by his terse metaphor of <hi>loathsom spitting,</hi> unles it be in citing of them upon occasion, somtimes, &amp; for the most part (if my memory miscarrieth not) approving their sayings, and sometimes, where just ground is, dissenting. This must be the <hi>English</hi> of Mr. <hi>Kendalls</hi> loathsom spitting; or otherwise his charging me with it, must be a thing much more loathsom than it. Lastly, For those names, <hi>Calvin, Beza, &amp;c.</hi> unto which, He, and his, so unanimously rise up with veneration, I am so far from comming so neer that nasty behaviour towards

For he approving such sayings and opinions of theirs, which savour of their weakness, and condemning such in either kind, which are correspondent with the truth, maketh a covering of their nakedness, to veil their strength and glory. Whereas I (on the contrary) justifying and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending such passages in their writings, which are worthy and sound, and subjecting those of another import, unto these, cover their nakedness with their glory. Let Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> judge who comes nearer, he, or I, to <hi>comminge</hi> or pisse on them. More especially, for <hi>Calvin;</hi> I cite more from him, and this with approbation and consent, from place to place, than (to my best remembrance) I do from any one Authour besides, thoroughout all my Book.</p>
               <p>Page 2. Of his Request to his Reader, he informs him (but <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> with untruth, and of what he can never prove) that <hi>the Sacred Oracles teach us to conclude for comfort, whence the natural reason concludes against it;</hi> if he had said, corrupt <hi>reason,</hi> or reason misguided by false principles, he had spake like a man. But he adds, (extravagantly enough to his premises,) <hi>And Mr. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win calls that hatred, which the Apostle stiles love, the chastening of the Lord.</hi> Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> I suppose chargeth me with this, rather upon account of his memory, than of his Conscience; but however, it is <hi>Christian</hi> in such cases, to make Conscience a Surveyor, or Examiner of our memories. But why doth he not in his Margent (as his manner is in other sayings cited from my Book) point at the page or Section, where that sad miscarriage of my pen, wherewith he taxeth me, is to be found? I may possibly somewhere say, that that which the Scripture calls <hi>love</hi> [1. An effect or fruit of <hi>love</hi>] in one sense, may in another sense (and this agreeable enough to Scripture Language too) be termed <hi>hatred,</hi> or an effect of hatred. But what is this to salve Mr. <hi>Kendalls</hi> Conscience in his charge?</p>
               <p>Part 3. p. 30. he saith, that <hi>for their persons, God according to my new speculations, neither loves, nor hates them, he scarce takes
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65873:115"/> notice of them.</hi> How doth the spirit of untruth rage in this saying? My known sense and judgement (as to this point) is, that Gods love to the <hi>persons</hi> of men (without exception) was so exceeding great, that he gave the greatest gift that ever was given by him upon any account whatsoever, even the gift of his only begotten Son, unto them, or for their sakes, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving in him they might have eternal life. Doth Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> call this <hi>no love, scarce any notice taken of the persons of men?</hi>

               <p>For I cannot think that Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> is willing to own the shame of those notorious untruths, wherewith he foules his Conscience in the passage now recited. For certain I am, that neither I, nor any of my Disciples (as he disgracefully termes he knoweth not who) at least so far as they have learned any

But is it out of modesty and tenderness of fore-head, that he writes his own name in the dust of a <hi>Dull Fellow?</hi> or rather ironically to tax <hi>my Disciples</hi> with so foul an oversight, as to decline the judgement of such a sharp-witted man as he, and to shew his Tenent about the love of God to men, no more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour, then as if he were a <hi>Dull Fellow.</hi> But if He playeth the Hypocrite, in calling himself <hi>Dull Fellow,</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself in the mean time, to be an acute and quaint-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, let him take heed lest the contents of this verse fall upon him;

               <p>A man would think that Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> had offered sacrifices e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>8</label> (in the former passage) to appease for one while, the wrath of that spirit of untruth, which so tyrannizeth over him. But behold the implacableness of this Spirit! He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently calls upon Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> for more sacrifices, and yet more commanding him first to say and affirm, that <hi>if men be brought to love God, yet according to my principles, God soon forgets his love to them, &amp;c.</hi> This saying is as expresly contrary to <hi>my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> as light is to darkness. For according to these, 1. God never forgets any thing, there being nothing perishable, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, or deficient in him. 2. Gods love is unchangeable, eternally and unremoveably set and fixed upon the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Object, and so upon the same kind of persons; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, upon the same individual persons, remaining the same in righteousness and true holiness. 3. And lastly, That a person who hath once been loved of God, is in no danger, in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65873:116"/> no possibility of loosing this love, by ordinary failings, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of infirmity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but onely upon the perpetration of such foul &amp; horrid sins; against which, the Kingdom of Heaven is shut by the hand of the Scripture. And if Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls</hi> Elect Beleeving ones, shall perpetrate such sins as these (as <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> and others did, yea and himself, and ohers as beleeving as himself, may possibly do) and yet continue in the saving love and favour of God, during their impenitency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, God must be supposed to have forgotten his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and to suffer his truth to fall. Secondly, (soon after his corrupting himself with the untruth last specified) he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth his Conscience to the asserting of another, telling me, that <hi>according to my new speculations, whether men will be saved, or no, stands purely at the Counsel of their own wills, not his</hi> [meaning Gods.]</p>
               <p>Reader, It is as far from me, and from <hi>my speculations,</hi> as the <hi>East</hi> is from the <hi>West,</hi> to hold, or implie, that it stands <hi>pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> at the <hi>Counsel of any mans will,</hi> and not <hi>Gods, whether he will,</hi> or shall <hi>be saved, or no.</hi> My sense (as to this) clearly and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly is, 1. That no man willeth salvation; but this will is wrought in him by God. 2. That it stands not at all <hi>at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of any mans will, whether he shall be saved, or no;</hi> but at the <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Gods will</hi> onely; and that the strength whereby men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and that the act it self of beleeving, as likewise that Law by which beleeving becomes available to the salvation of any man, are from God; and that none of them stand <hi>purely at the counsels of the wills of men.</hi>

               <p>Supposing Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> discourse in the respective veins and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of it, to hold due intelligence with his Principles, these being crooked and deceitfull, the discourse it self issuing from them, must needs partake of their shame, and so hold little or no communion with the truth. I shall (for brevity sake) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance onely some few of them: but by the complexion of these, a sufficient estimate may be made of the constitution of their fellows.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One of the Fundamentals of his discourse is, that <hi>the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick of the Holy Ghost, is of a different, yea contrary nature, to that of the natural man.</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Request to Reader, p. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> Something we touch'd of this in the last preceding Chapter. That this Principle is neither Truth, nor Truths Friend, appears, first, from hence; because, if so, then natural men are no competent judges of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or equity of Gods proceedings, which are still managed and carried according to Scripture Principles. And if they be no competent judges in this kinde, let Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> (at his peril) charge the most wise God with inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in appealing unto them in such cases, as he doth <hi>Isai</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23, 25, 29. Secondly, he who is enlightened by <hi>Christ,</hi> and receiveth Principles of Reason and Understanding from him, cannot in his <hi>Logick</hi> be contrary to the Holy Ghost in his; because <hi>Christ</hi> and the Holy Ghost are not at odds, nor divided in their Principles: nor doth <hi>Christ</hi> shine any light into the hearts or consciences of men, but what is of the same kinde, and well comporting with that light, which abounds without measure in himself. Now that natural men are enlightened by <hi>Christ,</hi> is evident, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. where he is said to be <hi>the true Light,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world;</hi> the sense of which Scripture hath been somewhat more opened else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.<note n="a" place="margin">Redemption redeemed, p. <hi>41.</hi>
                  </note> Thirdly, the natural mans Logick teacheth him to conclude peace and safety from righteousness and well-doing; as likewise, wrath and punishment from evil-doing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. But the Logick of the Holy Ghost argueth the same conclusion from the same premises, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> these two Logicks are not contrary, but comporting. Fourthly, if the natural mans Logick, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65873:118"/> the Logick of the Holy Ghost were contrary, all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Reasons, and Motives, by which the Holy Ghost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades such a man to believe, should be, in reference at least unto him, altogether improper, without all likelihood or tendency to prevail upon him to beleeve. But if the Atgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Motives used by the Holy Ghost in order to such an end, should be improper, and without all force and power to work upon the natural man, then do they contribute nothing at all towards his conversion, or bringing over to the Faith, and consequently should be used by him in vain. <hi>For if the Trumpet</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battail?</hi> Fifthly, if so, then a natural man coming into a place, or assembly, where the Logick of the Holy Ghost steereth and manageth the discourse, and all that is spoken, could not be convinced, or wrought upon in his judgment or conscience, by what he here heareth, any whit more, than if he were present at the chattering of Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, bleating of Sheep, lowing of Oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the case is far otherwise. <hi>If therefore the whole Church be come together into one place, and all speak with Tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbeleeving, will they not say, Ye are mad? But if all prophesie, and there come in one that beleeveth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all. And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest, and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a Truth.</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23, 24, 25.</note> Speaking in a strange Tongue, and speaking by a strange Logick, render him that speaketh a like <hi>Barbarian</hi> to him that heareth. The erroneousness and absurdity of the Principle of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> now under examination, might be by many other demonstrations evicted; but we judg it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently detected by the light already given; and besides, we intend not (at present) any full discussion of Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>

                  </note> The contradictiousness of this Principle to the sense of men of greatest learning and worth, both ancient and modern,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65873:118"/> yea of his fastest friends themselves in the point of limited Redemption, personal Reprobation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea of his own Assertions too elsewhere, will shortly be made to appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another account. The errour and absurdity of it appears, First, if it were so, then should the great work of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and salvation of the world, depend as well, and with as much necessity, upon the Son of perdition, as upon the Prince of Peace and Salvation; as well upon <hi>Judas,</hi> as upon <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> upon <hi>Judas</hi> his treason, as upon <hi>Christs</hi> love to mankinde; yea as much upon the butcherly and bloudy Priesthood of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, who murdered him, as upon his own most holy Priesthood, by virtue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he offered up himself. For certain it is, that <hi>Christ</hi> would never have laid violent hands upon himself. This Principle of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> highly justifies that heretical notion of the <hi>Cainites,</hi> (so reputed of old) who greatly reverenced <hi>Judas,</hi> for that great blessing, which by betraying <hi>Christ</hi> he brought unto the world.<note n="b" place="margin">Adorant si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militer Judam proditorem, eum arbitran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes aliquid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum esse, adeò quidem, ut ejus dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standum sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus ingens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficium repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, eum as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serentes prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scisse quantum esset generi humano Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti passio pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futura, ideó{que} illum Judaeis ad occidendum tradidisse.

                  </note> Secondly, if the <hi>actual</hi> dying of <hi>Christ</hi> was simply necessary for the salvation of the world, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the infinite worth of the Sacrifice it self (the Lamb of God) nor the transcendent excellency of the High Priest, who offered up this Sacrifice, (it being himself) nor yet his act in offering it, though performed after the most perfect manner that is imaginable, and upon terms of the richest and highest acceptation with God; none of these (I say) nor all of them together, were or would, or could have been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently meritorious for such a purpose, had they not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an augmentation or increase of merit from the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable sin of <hi>Judas.</hi> For (doubtless) <hi>Christ</hi> had as completely, or intirely, with as much love, humility, and devotion of soul, resigned up himself unto the will and pleasure of God his Father, before the instant of his suffering death, as he did in, or under, this instant it self. So that it is not imaginable how, or that, <hi>Christ</hi> should merit more by that death, unto which he was brought, and which was inflicted on him, by means of <hi>Judas</hi> his treason, than he had done by that death, which he had voluntarily and freely inflicted upon himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; I mean, that holy and humble submission of himself
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65873:119"/> unto his Fathers will, even to the suffering of actual death, in case he should leave him thus to suffer, (as he did.) Thirdly, if that Principle of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> under present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, be true, then should God have measured out harder and worse measure unto <hi>Christ,</hi> to whom the best measure was due (in the case we speak of) than he doth to ordinary men. For concerning these the Apostle expresly saith, that <hi>if there be first a willing minde, it is accepted</hi> [with God] <hi>according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.</note> His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clearly is, (as I have declared elsewhere<note n="b" place="margin">Redemption Redeemed. p. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note>) that where there is a clear, perfect, and upright desire of soul in any man, to perform any service pleasing unto God, but wants opportunity or means for the actual performance of it, and shall go in, or towards, the performance, as far as he hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and means to carry him, such a man findes the same acceptance with God under these deficiencies, which he should finde, by, or under, an actual or complete performance. So then, supposing that there was a clear, perfect, and intire willingness, or readiness of minde in <hi>Christ,</hi> to lay down his life for the world, but he had wanted an opportunity actually to have done it, (as suppose no man should have appeared to take away his life from him) there is no reason to think, but that he had been accepted with God upon the same terms, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in respect of such his willingness and desire, on which he is now accepted under his actual death. Therefore Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Principle makes God an accepter of persons, and this to the prejudice of the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself in point of acceptation with him, and this in the highest, most holy, and most worthy acceptation, service, that ever he performed. Fourthly, (and lastly) it is somewhat strange that M. <hi>Kend.</hi> who smites his Brethrens reputations in the face, upon a pretence of their abridging God in his Prerogative, and seeks to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himself as a special Friend of God in this behalf, should notwithstanding deny a Prerogative-liberty unto him, of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the world, how &amp; upon what terms he had pleased, limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confining him to one particular way or means onely; especially considering that elsewhere he makes this boast, <hi>We do present Gods power as greater, we do not represent his love

               <p>Another of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Principles is, that <hi>in Scripture-Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, <label type="milestone">

               <p>

His meaning clearly enough is; that though a thing, simply and in the nature of it considered, be unjust, yet Gods doing of it would alter and change the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of it, and of unjust would make it to become just. Such a Principle as this is little less than blasphemous, and so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the first-born of those men, at the sound of whose names Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> and his <hi>Oxfordians,</hi> are wont to rise up (as it were) in an ecstasie of veneration,<note n="d" place="margin">Latin.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> Another of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> principles is, that <hi>Gods love to man, and the death of the Son of God for him, is a mystery too high to be reach'd, yea to be received by any natural man.</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Request to the Reader, p. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> Soon after he saith of this mystery, that <hi>it is so great, that it cannot possibly be known without outward Revelation, and inward Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Yea this principle is a principal pillar in Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> building: we have the matter and substance of it in a very importune and confident manner, avouched by him ten times over. But how erroneous it is, and otherwise prejudicial to the affairs of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the world, appears with greatest evidence, by these few considerations amongst many others:</p>
               <p>First, if the Gospel be <hi>too high to be reach'd, yea or received by any natural man,</hi> then is it impossible that any natural man
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65873:120"/> should ever become spiritual, or be regenerate; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Regeneration, and so Salvation depending hereon, must for ever be banished out of the world: yea and Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> himself must be content to be numbred amongst his <hi>natural</hi> men, whom he makes uncapable of understanding and judging aright of his notions. The reason of the consequence is pregnant; because impossible it is for any man to be made spiritual or a regenerate man, without the knowledg of the love of God in <hi>Christ,</hi> and of the Gospel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be impossible that any natural man should reach or receive the Gospel, impossible it is that any natural man should ever be regenerate; and consequently, if Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> ever was a natural man, he must remain such to this day, yea and to eternity. Well is it for him, that this <hi>Principle</hi> of his, and the Truth, are two: if they did conspire, it would be to his misery and ruine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if <hi>to know that what Mr.</hi> Kendal <hi>saith of</hi> Christ, is true, <hi>be beyond t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e natural mans capacity,</hi> why should it not be as much, or more, beyond the Devils capacity to know it? considering first, that the Devils fall was every whit as great (if not farre greater) than the fall of men, and consequently more like to shake, shatter, and confound their intellectuals. Secondly, that the Devils live in as great, or rather greater, estrangement from God, as natural men do; yea and have every whit as little communion with the holy Spirit of God, without whose immediate Revelation Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> saith, The Gospel cannot be known, as unregenerate men. Now evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is from several passages in the Gospel, which might readily be produced and argued close to the point, that if Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> speaketh those things of <hi>Christ,</hi> which are true, it is <hi>not beyond the capacity</hi> of the Devils to know that they are true. Therefore why should it be beyond the capacity of the natural man to know as much?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if it be beyond the capacity of the natural man to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> know that which is truly said of <hi>Christ,</hi> to be true, then had the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> no reason at all to wonder, nor yet to take any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn offence at the unbelief of natural or unregenerate men;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65873:121"/> which notwithstanding he did, and this more than once, as the Gospel testifieth. <hi>And he marvelled at their unbeleef,</hi> Mark 6.6. <hi>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they beleeved not on him. That the saying of</hi> Esaias <hi>the Prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath beleeved our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? &amp;c.</hi> John 12.37, 38. <hi>For neither did his Brethren be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him,</hi> John 7.5. <hi>And if I say the truth, why do you not beleeve me?</hi> John 8.46. <hi>Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not beleeve,</hi> John 4.48. (to omit many like.) The reason of the consequence in this argument also, is very evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no man of judgment, indeed no man consistent in his wits, marvelleth or wondereth at a man, or is offended at a man, because being in danger of his life, he doth not flie in the air like a Bird to make an escape, or doth not presently vanish out of sight like a spirit. The non-performance of known impossibilities, is no sober mans wonder. Doth Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> wonder or marvel that his Thorns do not yeeld him Grapes, or his Thistles Figs? If he wondereth that all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and regenerate men do not sympathize in judgment with him in his principles and notions, it is a demonstrative sign that he is ignorant that there are considering men, and of free judgments, in the present generation.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>6</label> Fourthly, if it be beyond the capacity of a natural man to know, or beleeve the truth of the Gospel, then are unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers under the Gospel, and the most effectual Ministery of it, altogether as excusable under the crime and guilt of their unbeleef, as Heathens, Pagans, and all such, who never so much as heard of the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> are under theirs. But this is a Bone, which I beleeve Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> is loth to swallow. The consequence is above all reasonable denial; because that excusableness which in equity belongs to <hi>Pagans,</hi> and all others amongst whom the sound of the Gospel never came, in reference to their unbeleef, is founded upon the weakness and scantness of those means, which God was pleased to grant unto them in order to their beleeving. If then the means for beleeving which natural men have, living under the Ministery oi the Gospel, be as insufficient, or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65873:121"/> (which is the same) leave them under a like impossibility of beleeving, with the others, are they not altogether as excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? It is a Maxime in the Civil Law, full of reason and equity; <hi>All means that are insufficient for a performance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Omnia invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da nihilo sunt aequiparanda.</note>
                  <hi>are to be counted as none,</hi> or as good as nothing. If a King should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand two men of his Subjects to fly up to the Sun, to bring him news of what is to do there, and should afford unto the one two Feathers, (suppose of a great Eagle) to help him to do what's commanded him in this case, but should not allow so much as one Feather unto the other; would the privilege of the two Feathers render him, to whom they were given, more inexcusable under a non-performance of the service imposed, than his fellow? If it be as impossible for one natural man to beleeve under the Ministery of the Gospel, as it is for another to beleeve without it, doubtless the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is altogether as excusable under his not beleeving, as the other.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it is evident that <hi>Agrippa</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>7</label> him, was but a natural man, and none of the best of this order neither; he was not so much as a Professor of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity:</hi> yet <hi>Paul</hi> gave this testimony unto him, that he <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved the Prophets: King</hi> Agrippa, <hi>beleevest thou the Prophets?

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 26.27.</note> Now they who beleeve the Prophets, cannot but know, and beleeve some things, if not many, that are said of <hi>Christ</hi> to be truth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. What doth Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> think of those, who as the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> himself prophesieth, <hi>will say unto him in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy Name, and in thy Name have cast out Devils? and in thy Name done many wonderfull works?</hi>

The truth is, that the Principle against which we have now entered our contest, is so broadly erroneous and destructive to the interest of the Gospel, that I cannot readily think of any one errour now on foot in the <hi>Christian</hi> world, more obnoxious both to the Scriptures, as also to all Principles, whether in Religion, or in reason otherwise, or which is of a more facil, ready, and pregnant conviction, and confutation, than it.

               <p>For he hath onely this fancy to oppose against that great and happy Notion and Truth, first discovered by <hi>Augustine</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:65873:123"/> in the Scriptures, and since owned and imployed by <hi>Gregory, Anselm, Aquinas,</hi> and many others, as well School-men, as men of other and better learning, <hi>viz.</hi> that God by one and the same great Creative Act, indesinent, and un-intermitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, gave, and gives being to all Creatures whatsoever, in what order, when, and at what times and seasons himself pleaseth. But the weakness of that conceit of Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> now mentioned, requires neither much strength, nor length of argument to evict it. For if that Action, or Act, by which God produceth and gives being unto things produced (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively) by him, be really the same thing with the thing which it produceth, then must it needs be finite, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a creature. For, first, nothing that is infinite, can be really the same with that which is finite, no more than it is possible for God to be, or to become a Creature. Secondly, whatsoever is finite, must needs be a Creature: <hi>the beggerly Elements of Logick,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> somewhere stileth them) yea of common sense it self, are sufficient Teachers of the truth of these things. Now then, if the Act, by which God produceth Creatures, be a Creature it self, and the same Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>really</hi> with that produced by it: then first, one Creature in the Creation of the World created another, at least was created by another: yea, and secondly, every Creature created it self, yea and now createth or produceth it self, or (which is the same) that which is really the same with it. These are the depths of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> learning, which (I remember) we have sounded elsewhere, and found them flats and shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>But amongst all Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Principles (as far as yet I <label type="milestone">

Or may not a man be rich and wealthy without end, in case he hath Silver and Gold enough, unless he hath a Talent of Lead also, properly so called amongst his substance?

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65873:124"/> seven, have gone over his head, since he had <hi>sufficient means</hi> to have understood, that he that ascribeth both <hi>knowledg,</hi> and <hi>foreknowledg</hi> unto God, by way of eminency, highly honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him; and on the contrary, that he that attributeth either the one or the other unto him, literally, formally, properly, constructively, blasphemeth him. For he that conceiteth or imagineth, that God hath any thing at all in him, which is properly, formally, or specifically the same with any thing found in any Creature whatsoever, must of necessity deny the infinity of his nature, in asmuch as there is nothing found in any creature, but what is finite; and if there be any thing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in God, he cannot be infinite. Besides, if <hi>knowledg</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called, were in God, then must there be some acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in him, properly so called also: for that knowledg which is in men, is most properly, &amp; in the generical nature of it, and essentially, an accident: so that what knowledg soever is not an accident, cannot possibly be <hi>properly</hi> or <hi>formally</hi> the same with it. But Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Principle, denying <hi>knowledg</hi> and <hi>foreknowledg</hi> by way of eminency unto God, and contending for such a kinde of knowledg in him in stead thereof, as that which is found in men, remembreth me of the <hi>Latine</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Stultorum gratia ingrata.</hi> And he that shall pretend to honour God by such Doctrines or Principles, as this, had he been in being when time was, might have served in the same troop with those, who, when they kill'd the Disciples of <hi>Christ,</hi> supposed they <hi>did God service.</hi> But whereas he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth between <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>properly,</hi> acknowledging, that neither knowledg nor foreknowledg are in God <hi>formally,</hi> but affirming it Tooth and Nail that they are both in him <hi>properly;</hi> I confess I understand not his dialect, wherein he speaketh: his <hi>Logick</hi> (and so his <hi>Metaphysicks</hi>) and mine, in this, (as in twenty things more) are <hi>Barbarians</hi> the one unto the other.

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>11</label> But whereas, in attempting to heal the deadly wound of his opinion, inslicted on it by the right hand of Truth in my Argument assaulting it, he saith, that when things foreknown by God come to pass, there is <hi>no need to acknowledg any change in his foreknowledg, otherwise than what is by extrinsical denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> doth he not prevaricate with his cause, and plainly grant, that the <hi>foreknowledg</hi> of these things was not <hi>properly,</hi> but onely <hi>eminently,</hi> in God? For, foreknowledg properly so called, must of necessity suffer an alteration in the very existence and being of it, and not by <hi>extrinsical denomination</hi> onely, when the things foreknown by it, are come to pass, and actually present; however foreknowledg <hi>eminently</hi> such, suffers no such <hi>alteration,</hi> or change. A man that foreknoweth that on <hi>March</hi> 10. 1656. the Sun will rise at six of the clock,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65873:125"/> when the Sun hath risen the same day at this hour, this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression or act of foreknowledg in him really expireth, and ceaseth. And it is every whit as true now to say, that this man hath not that individual foreknowledg in him, which was in him before, as it is to say, that he cannot be said still to foreknow the same thing that is already come to pass. Whereas if it could be supposed, that the <hi>foreknowledg</hi> we speak of, were onely <hi>eminently</hi> such in the man, and not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly;</hi> That is, that this his foreknowledg were really and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially the same thing with his nature or being, then the coming to pass of the said event, would not make any real change in his foreknowledg; onely he could not now be said to foreknow the same thing, because the thing it self, being past, is not in a condition or possibility, of being foreknown. And in this case, there would no real alteration or change at all, in one kinde or other, be made in such a person, or in his foreknowledg, by the coming to pass of the thing. But in case it should be said of him, that now he doth not, or cannot foreknow it, the meaning (to make the saying true) must be, not that the person hath suffered any detriment or loss in his foreknowledg by the coming to pass of the said event, but onely that the objects of his foreknowledg remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, or of his being, considered as his foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, are now fewer by one, than before.</p>
               <p>Nor will Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> instance of Gods <hi>resting the seventh day,</hi> any ways releeve him. For if God should have wrought during the six days, as he notioneth him to have done, <hi>i.</hi> should have <hi>de novo</hi> exercised, or exerted so many transient acts of his power, as there were creatures created by him, his <hi>resting the seventh day</hi> must of necessity have inferred a real mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yea a real and actual mutation in him. For he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and properly worketh to day, and shall as really cease to work to morrow, is by such an alteration sufficiently evinced to be, or to have been, really mutable, and subject to a change. But the reason why Gods <hi>resting the seventh day,</hi> makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all against his absolute immutability, is, because the said expression importeth onely this, that all those Creatures,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65873:126"/> unto which God intended to give being, within the compass of the six days of the Creation, by that one great creative Act from eternity, <hi>quo totum ens profudit, &amp; omnes e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And because these six days being expired, God by the said creative Act gave no more new being, made no more <hi>Species</hi> of Creatures, therefore he is said to have <hi>rested the seventh day.</hi> But these speculations are (I perceive) to Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi>'s <hi>Ingeniolum,</hi> of a like relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.39.</note> with that of the sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> unto <hi>David, too hard</hi> for it.</p>

What if there never had been a wicked person, or <hi>Opposer of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> found in the world, (which he took a sufficient course

Is this the Doctrine <hi>commonly held by the Reformed Churches,</hi> and of which Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> glorieth to be the <hi>Vindicator?</hi> Let me be <hi>Heterodox,</hi> if this be <hi>Orthodox.</hi> Nor doth it salve the sore of this blasphemous Principle, to say, <hi>The Decrees of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine every one, necessitate none, so as to deprive them of their freedom, or involve him in their sins.</hi> For though it be most true, that <hi>the Decrees of God necessitate none, so as to deprive them of their freedom, or involve him in their sins;</hi> so is it most untrue, and absolutely inconsistent with such a saying, that <hi>the Decrees of God determine every one.</hi> For he that is left at <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or to have his <hi>freedom,</hi> may either act, if he pleaseth, or refrain from acting, if he pleaseth; at least if we take the words, <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> as they are attributable unto the Creature, and are wont to be taken generally in these debates. But he that is <hi>determined,</hi> at least by a <hi>determination,</hi> which is infrustrable and irreversible, (as Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> I presume, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth all Gods <hi>Determinations</hi> to be) cannot act if he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and forbear to act if he pleaseth. For what in this case becomes of his being <hi>determined?</hi> Or in case he were not <hi>determined,</hi> in what other posture or habitude, in reference to acting, or non-acting, could he be imagined to be? Or is that <hi>determination of every one,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> by his false Optick descrieth in God, a meer nothing, and which influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceth the Creature, or the determined, nothing at all? And if <hi>every one be determined</hi> by God, it must be supposed that he is <hi>determined,</hi> either to act, or to forbear acting.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> A first-fruits of the great Harvest of Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi>'s simple and inconsiderate passages and sayings. Whether Gods Will be the Reason of his Counsel? Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> in stead of the love of <hi>Christ, Ephes. 3.18.</hi> interprets the Cross of <hi>Christ.</hi> Whether God hath always used the weak things of the world to confound the mighty? Concerning a meer natural man. Whether it be proper, or Clerk-like, to ascribe transient operations unto God, or whether these be the essences of the things produced by God? Whether by ascribing one great creative Act unto God, I deny all power unto him? Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the settling of Religion by the State. Whether Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> hath a considerable share in the dull virtue of Patience? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the necessity of <hi>Christ</hi>'s actual dying. Whether the Doctrine of Gods Providence be shaken, by denying that the beginnings and ends of many things are determined by him? Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> makes the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> to speak at a lower rate, than he himself (ordinarily.) Contradicts his own Principles and Doctrines.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65873:128"/> Of Gods extraordinary aiding the Elect by his Spirit. Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> understandeth not the right Method of Preaching the Gospel.</head>
               <p>ANother vein running in the body of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Book, is of sayings and expressions very simple, indigested, and inconsiderate. A goodly Retinue might be rallied of this character also. In his <hi>Latine</hi> Address to his Mother <hi>Oxford,</hi> he beflatters her with this blasphemous salutation of <hi>Sanctis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima Mater, Most holy Mother;</hi> as if his <hi>Mother</hi> were greater in holiness, not onely than all the Angels in Heaven, who have no degree of <hi>Holiness</hi> any where in Scripture ascribed unto them, but what is expressed in the positive term, <hi>Holy;</hi> but than the Lord <hi>Christs</hi> Father himself, to whom he prayeth in the positive stile onely of <hi>Holy Father. John</hi> 17.11. In one place he flasheth the fire of his wit in my face; <hi>Coleman-street</hi> (saith he) <hi>is nearer to</hi> Rome, <hi>than</hi> Sion-College <hi>is to Coleman-street.</hi> If <hi>Rome</hi> were as near to <hi>Blisland,</hi> as (it seems) it is to <hi>Coleman-street,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> would have the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of releeving the widowhood of his <hi>most holy Mother,</hi> by mediating a match between her, and his <hi>most holy Father,</hi> the <hi>Pope.</hi> But whether <hi>Coleman-street</hi> be nearer to <hi>Rome,</hi> or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, than either <hi>Blisland</hi> or <hi>Sion-College,</hi> certain I am, that it is much nearer to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> than either. Towards the end of his Epistle to Dr. <hi>Whichcote, &amp;c.</hi> speaking to the praise (as he presumeth) of himself and his party, <hi>We</hi> (saith he) <hi>rest in his [i.</hi> God<hi>'s] will, as the Reason of his Counsel.</hi> Though the truth be, that in the things of which he speaks, they [he, and his party] <hi>rest</hi> in their own <hi>wills,</hi> not in God's; yet how un-Scripture-like, and reasonless withall, is it to say, that <hi>they rest in Gods will, as the Reason of his Counsel,</hi> when as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1, 11.</note> that God <hi>worketh all things,</hi> not according to the Will of his Counsel, but <hi>according to the Counsel of his Will;</hi> clearly implying that the Wisdom or <hi>Counsel of God</hi> is the Reason of his <hi>Will,</hi> not his Will of his Counsel. But (it
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65873:128"/> seems) because Mr. <hi>Kendal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> will is so frequently all the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Counsels,</hi> therefore measuring God by himself, (which is too too incident to men to do) he apprehends the like in him.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Request</hi> to his <hi>Reader, p.</hi> 2. upon the <hi>Basis</hi> of these words, <hi>Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God that works in you to will and to do, of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> he reareth up this Pillar, which supports a great part of the Fabrick of his Book, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>inability is in Scripture-Logick a ground for exhortation to duty;</hi> as if the Creature Man were disabled unto duty, by <hi>Gods working in him to will and to do, &amp;c.</hi> For this <hi>working of God</hi> in him is clearly held forth as the motive or ground of that <hi>exhortation unto duty,</hi> which is here given; not the creatures inability to perform the duty.</p>
               <p>In an <hi>Apostrophe to worthy Mr. Rector of</hi> Exceter <hi>College,</hi> he quits himself (to his small credit) thus: <hi>I have lift up my<note place="margin">§. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

But of this worthy passage somewhat more ere long. Nor (doubtless) is this Petition (expressed in his Prayer to God for his Mother with her Children, and dignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Note of <hi>Specialty</hi> above all its fellow-petitions in this Prayer) very considerate, wherein he prayeth, that <hi>the God of peace would enable them, that they may comprehend with all Saints what is the height, and depth, and length, and breadth of the Cross of Christ.</hi> Notwithstanding, if by <hi>the Cross of Christ,</hi> he means (as the Scripture commonly doth) the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Petition (I confess) is very seasonable and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignly necessary on the behalf of the <hi>Rector,</hi> Fellows, and Students of <hi>Exceter</hi>-College, in case they be of the same scant and unworthy opinion with Mr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> concerning the Death of <hi>Christ.</hi> For if this be so, they had need be enabled by God to <hi>comprehend the heighth, and depth, the length and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65873:129"/> breadth [i.</hi> the just and true dimensions, the large and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous extent] of this Death, being so much in the dark concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. But (doubtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ss) the Popish Notion and conceit of the figure of the material Cross of <hi>Christ,</hi> signified (as they commonly interpret) by the Apostle in that Text of Scripture, unto which Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> here alludeth, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.18.) was in Councel with his <hi>Ingeniolum,</hi> when he drew up the said Petition. For the Apostle doth not speak of the <hi>Cross</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> in all that Context of Scripture, nor doth he attribute the four dimensions specified to the <hi>Cross,</hi> but rather to the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65873:129"/> enough to answer</hi> very little to what is argued against his fond Tenents. But though he <hi>thinks it enough to answer</hi> the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onists he speaks of, with that question of the Apostle, which he cites, yet the Apostle himself did not <hi>think it enough</hi> so to answer them, but over and above that <hi>question,</hi> demonstrates the equity and reasonableness of Gods complaining of men under those dispensations, which, as they supposed, rendered wicked and obdurate sinners every ways excusable; as is to be seen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22, 23. But it is a small thing, and matter of course onely, with Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> to make himself wiser than an Apostle, yea than the wisest of them all.</p>
               <p>Nor was he much better advised in these words, <hi>We say that <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>4</label> the love of God to us in</hi> Christ <hi>is so great, that the greatness of it makes it inconceivable; and hence it is, that it is impossible to be known by a meer natural man, because it passeth knowledg.</hi> First, Mr. <hi>Kendals meer natural man</hi> is (doubtless) an <hi>Utopian</hi> native; unless by a <hi>me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In this sense, is it not most gravely and truly said of him, that <hi>the greatness of the love of God to us in</hi> Christ <hi>is so great, that it is impossible to be known by a childe as s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on as he is come into the world?</hi> It is profound Divinity (it seems) with Mr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> to argue and teach, that <hi>Christ</hi> fed more than five hundred persons, when <hi>he fed five thousand men, besides women and children.</hi> Else I would gladly know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he met with his <hi>meer natural man, i.</hi> a man in his pure naturals, who neither on the one hand had contracted the guilt of any sinfull habit, or custome, or action, nor drank in any erroneous or false apprehension, more than what he brought with him into the world; nor on the other hand had received from God any further illumination or grace, in one kinde or other, than what accompanied him from the womb. When Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> and others discourse so largely of the <hi>meer natural man,</hi> they do but talk of <hi>Paracelsus</hi> his <hi>Non-Adami.</hi> There is no man, (I mean, no person of years and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion) but is either more erroneous and sinfull, or else more knowing and virtuous, than he was, when nature divided him
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65873:130"/> from the womb. And if he be any ways either thus impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or improved, it is a plain case, that he is not a <hi>meer natural man.</hi> Secondly, when he gives this for a Reason, why <hi>the love of God to us by</hi> Christ <hi>is impossible to be known by a meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man, viz.</hi> because <hi>it is inconceivable, and passeth knowledg;</hi> Doth he not make it every whit as <hi>impossible to be known</hi> by his spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

When he telleth us not long after, (speaking of the same love of God) that <hi>it is so great that it cannot possibly be known, without outward revelation, and inward regeneration;</hi> Doth he not suppose, either first, an impossibility that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should ever be <hi>regenerated;</hi> or else secondly, that a man may be regenerated, without the knowledg of the love of God in <hi>Christ?</hi> For if this love cannot be known by a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man,</hi> or without <hi>inward regeneration,</hi> how shall a <hi>natural man</hi> ever come to be inwardly <hi>regenerate,</hi> unless he may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated without the knowledg of this love? And if so, how can Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> say, (but that he hath the faculty of saying any thing) that the love of God is impossible to be known by a <hi>natural man?</hi> But such confusions, absurdities, and distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed notions, as these, are as common in the Minister of <hi>Blis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Book, as Silver was in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in <hi>Solomons</hi> days.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>5</label> For not long before the disaster of the last mentioned saying, he had dreamed this dream, <hi>This is that on which we lay the main stress of our d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>spute, the exceeding riches of the love of God in</hi> Christ, <hi>not possible to be known by men, unless immediately taught by the Spirit of God: and therefore all are not capable of knowing, and consequently not of receiving, the benefit of</hi> Christ<hi>'s sacrifice.</hi> The time would fail me to shew the interpretation of this dream at large, and of the respective fancies, of which it consists. First, what may we imagine his grammatical or rhetorical meaning to be, when he saith, that <hi>the exceeding riches of the love of God in</hi> Christ, <hi>is that, on which he lays the main
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65873:130"/> stress of his dispute?</hi> If the mans meaning be this, that he lays the <hi>main stress, i.</hi> the whole weight or burthen of his dispute, <hi>upon the exceeding riches of the love of God in</hi> Christ, to prejudice, oppress, or imbezel these riches; this sense (I confess) maketh a truth, and holds as good correspondence with the words, as any other. If his meaning be, that the principal strength of his <hi>dispute</hi> is bent to commend, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, or avouch the <hi>exceeding riches</hi> he speaks of, this (besides that it hath no good grammatical accord with the words) is at open defiance with the Truth. For the soveraign bent and engagement of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> dispute, is to <hi>non-suit the exceeding riches of the love of God</hi> to men <hi>in Christ,</hi> and to diminish and cut off more than ten parts of twelve of the <hi>exceedingness</hi> of them. Again, secondly, whereas he affirmeth, that <hi>the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riches of the love of God in</hi> Christ <hi>are not possibly to be known by men, unless immediately taught by the Spirit of God,</hi> doth he not deny the necessity and use of the letter of the Gospel, and the oral Ministery hereof, and that which he soon after (as we lately heard) cals <hi>outward Revelation</hi> in order to the conversion of men? For what must of necessity be <hi>taught immediately by the Spirit of God,</hi> needeth not to be taught, nay cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be taught (effectually) by the mediation of any outward instrument, cause, or means whatsoever. Thirdly, (and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) his double inference from the premisses, <hi>And therefore all are not capable, &amp;c.</hi> is wilder and more sensless than all the rest. For first, is any man less <hi>capable than another of knowing the unsearchable riches of the love of God in Christ,</hi> because they must be <hi>immediately taught by the Spirit of God?</hi> Or is not the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> as able <hi>immediately</hi> to teach or reveal these <hi>riches</hi> unto any one man, as unto another? Secondly, if all men be alike <hi>capable of knowing</hi> these <hi>riches of the love of God by the immediate teaching of the Spirit of God,</hi> then certainly they are alike <hi>capable of receiving the benefit of</hi> Christ<hi>'s sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> But such <hi>Non sequitur's</hi> as these are no rarities (it seems) in our <hi>English Scythia,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> dwells.</p>
               <p>In one place he saith thus, <hi>But to know that what we say of</hi>

                  </note> If his sense be general, and collective, comprehending all that which he, and his party, say of <hi>Christ;</hi> I think the saying is as true, as any in all his Book besides. For I verily beleeve that he, and his partizans <hi>say</hi> many things of <hi>Christ,</hi> which it is not onely <hi>beyond the capacity of the natural man,</hi> but of the spiritual man also, yea and of all the Angels in Heaven, <hi>to know to be true.</hi> If his meaning be distributive and particular, as that it is beyond the natural mans capacity to know <hi>any thing</hi> to be true, which he and his say of <hi>Christ,</hi> I desire to know of him in his Rejoinder, whether, when they say this of <hi>Christ,</hi> that he is not fully known or beleeved on, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men, he conceives it to be <hi>beyond the natural mans capacity</hi> to know, that this is true.

If Mr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> and men of his minde, be afraid, or ashamed, to come into the presence of the most holy God, whose Name is <hi>Jealous,</hi> with such a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65873:131"/> Prayer as this in their mouths, it is a sign that they are, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afraid, or ashamed, or both, to pray according to their Faith.</p>

                     <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 149.</note> Is there any whit more sap or savour in this consequence, than there would be in this; if I ascribe all power unto God, I must needs deny all power unto him? Or when I do ascribe such a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act unto him, do I not ascribe omnipotency, or all power unto him? His Reason to prove his consequence, is every whit as uncouth and madly, as the Consequence it self. <hi>Malo nodo malus cuneus,</hi> an untoward knot (it seems) must have an untoward wedg to rive it. <hi>I prove it thus,</hi> (saith he) <hi>God had never power to generate his Son: for that then there was somewhat conceivable before the Son was generated, which power to do cannot be: nor was the generation of the Son an act of power: for then some power is in the Father more than the Son, for the Son hath none to beget a Son: but that cannot be said, without making the Son not almighty, nor coequal to the Father: thus we put an act without power in God; but to put any other act from eternity, as you do, is to put the like, and if not, to make an alteration.</hi> Thus farre Mr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> and (I think) farre beyond the understanding of Men and Angels; certain I am, farre beyond mine. But what? Doth he conceive that the Father generated the Son without any, without all kinde of power? Doubtless he did generate him, not indeed by a creative, but by a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son was impossible to the Father; and so turn <hi>Arian,</hi> and deny the Godhead of the Son. For that which God hath no power, no kinde of power, to do, must needs be impossible for him to do. Nor doth it follow, in case the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be said to have a power to generate a Son, and the Son
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65873:132"/> no power to generate a Son also, that therefore the Son is not coequal with the Father, at least in that sense of coequality, which all Divines and others understand, who understand themselves. For who ever taught or held, that the Son is <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to the Father</hi> in proprieties of personal relation, or that he hath begotten a Son, as the Father hath, or is in a capacity so to do? The coequality of the Son to the Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, and consists in, not personal, but essential properties. And is it not a strange saying to fall from a man, that is <hi>compo mentis, Thus we put an act without power in God?</hi> Is it not the same with this: we suppose God to have done, or to do, that which he never was, nor is able to do? But (I speak it with all clearness and ingenuity of spirit) Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> in his discoursings (generally) about the nature of God, his Attributes, Properties, Purposes, Intentions, Decrees, Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, immanent, transient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> travelleth so farre out of the roade of other mens notions and apprehensions, and at such an huge distance from my Principles, that he is (upon the matter) in these things altogether inaccessible to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. Neither shall I take example by him, to put my self upon a necessity of <hi>refreshing my spirits with a merry frolick, by being tired with following him through thick and thin, Thorns and Briars, to seek him out where he seems to have lost himself, as well as the Truth.</hi>

               <p>A little after the place, where Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Pen last faltred, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>8</label> and committed the grand oversight (now exhibited) he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth and instructeth me, that when I say, that <hi>most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, there is no change in God;</hi> this is upon the matter to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65873:132"/> deny the Conclusion. But good Sir, whose <hi>Conclusion</hi> is it, which you charge me here, (upon the matter) to <hi>deny?</hi> Is it your Conclusion? Or is it concluded in your Doctrine, that there is a change in God? If it be not yours, why do you make your self aggrieved at it? But (say I, as you transcribe me) <hi>His essence is unchangeable, and so his operations, being the same with his essence.</hi> The words are not such that I need be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of them; yet Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> may well be ashamed of curtailing my sayings in his Transcriptions, as for the most part he doth all along his Book; but the words he thinks are somewhat volatile, and therefore he attempts to fix them, with this explication, or distinction: <hi>Restrain it you must to immanent operations, or else not true; for surely transient operations are not the same with his essence, but with the essence rather of things produced by him.</hi> Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> never spake truer, nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clearer grounds, (if he apprehended them) than when he saith, <hi>Surely transient operations are not the same with Gods essence. Transient operations</hi> (at least properly so called) know no other Operators, or univocal Parents of their beings, but Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And most shiningly certain it is, that no operation of the Creature is the <hi>same with Gods essence.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> meaning (it seems) is to put the honour (as he weakly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough supposeth) of <hi>transient operations</hi> upon God. Whether, or in what sense, such operations as these are attributable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, is elsewhere briefly argued in these Papers. Here I onely take notice how inconsiderately, and inconsistently with his notion it self, he affirms them to be <hi>the same with the essences of the things produced by God.</hi> For, as for his comparative Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, <hi>rather,</hi> I conceive it rather Pleonastical, than Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or significative. If then first, the <hi>transient operations</hi> of God be not the same with his <hi>essence,</hi> then are they nothing of God. For there is nothing in God but personality, or relation, and essence; and to say, that they are the same with the persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of God, is (I suppose) no temptation to any mans thoughts. If they be not the same with his <hi>essence,</hi> or (which is the same) nothing of him, how can they give being to those things, which he saith are produced by them? Again, to say, <hi>They are the same with the essences of things produced by them,</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:65873:133"/> is yet more loudly dissonant from reason. For being, as he saith, productive of things, and consequently of their es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences, respectively (in as much as nothing can be without its essence) it roundly follows, that if they be <hi>the same with these essences,</hi> then these <hi>essences</hi> must be produced by themselves, and receive being by, or from themselves, or (which is the same) from those things, which are the same with them. So that Mr. <hi>Kendals Philosophico-theologie</hi> about the <hi>transient Acts,</hi> which he ascribeth unto God, hath neither footing nor foundation, either in Scripture, or good Reason, no nor yet in common sense, but is meerly aerial, and sister to the winde.</p>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65873:133"/> elsewhere, that as sometimes he quarrels with me for new notions and <hi>rarities,</hi> so otherwise he makes himself offended at my notions, for being stale and common. Yea, how many passages and sayings of mine doth he justifie and own from place to place in his Books, suffering them to pass by him in peace, yea and some with some honour?

Whilest it is a question which is God, it is no question, neither will be served.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65873:134"/> this Principle, but in a short time it proved the molestation, danger, and disturbance of this State, if not the ruine and overthrow also, in the end.

Thirdly, because he makes it <hi>the Interest of States to see God served in the first place;</hi> as if first, <hi>the service of God</hi> were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, (for I suppose he speaks of that serving of God, which is pleasing to him, in as much as <hi>to see God served</hi> otherwise, is contrary to <hi>the Interest of States.</hi>) Secondly, as if it were in the power of States, to <hi>see</hi> or provide by force, that men shall serve God <hi>in spirit and in truth:</hi> for besides. and without this, there is no service but is the abhorring of his Soul. Thirdly, as if <hi>the Interest of States</hi> were to <hi>see</hi> that all under their government, beleeve as they beleeve, and that there be no difference in any mans judgment or conscience, from their own. Fourthly, as if God could not be <hi>served in the first place</hi> by the people of a State, unless the Magistrate provided that they first be all of the same minde and judgment in all things, even in things of the profoundest consideration, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65873:134"/> of the most <hi>doubtfull disputation,</hi> between men of greatest parts and learning, yea and piety also, in the <hi>Christian</hi> world. Fifthly, because he supposeth a narrow and exact inquiry after Truth, or a discovery of the Errours commonly held by Professours of Religion, to be a <hi>disturbing of Religion;</hi> whereas there is no way under Heaven like unto it, for that which he pretends to be the darling of his soul I mean, the <hi>settlement of Religion.</hi> For certainly true Religion will never be settled upon hollow or false foundations, or such, the stability and firmness of whose Truth are not mightily evidenced and brought forth into a very clear light before men. Sixthly, because he supposeth, that whilest Religion is unsettled (as he calleth it) in a State, [that is, untill all differences in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion be determined, or laid asleep, either by the Word, or by the Sword] there must needs be a question in this State, <hi>whether God be God, or</hi> Baal <hi>be God;</hi> as if every diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in point of Religion, being interpreted, amounts to no less, than to a doubtfull dispute, whether he that made Heaven and Earth, or a dumb Idol, be the true God. Seventhly, (and lastly) because (that which is more considerable than all the rest) he supposeth, that <hi>Christian</hi> Religion settled in a State according to his judgment and sense in the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies about Election, Reprobation, Redemption, with the rest confederate with these, must needs tend to the prosperity, peace, and well-being of this State; as if a Systeme or body of Doctrine of a manifest tendency, first, to perswade the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, or farre the greatest part of the people into a despair of salvation; Secondly, to perswade all men into a conceit that they neither shall, nor can, do any thing, good or evil, but what hath been decreed and determined by God, that they shall do, and consequently, what shall be irresistibly necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to do; Thirdly, to perswade them into a like conceit, that whatsoever they shall do, or rather seem to do, God more principally and properly doth it, and must do it, than they; Fourthly, (and lastly) which upon these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts must needs render all Laws and Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Where also I have proved that the Scriptures themselves no where declare for such a <hi>necessity,</hi> but rather for the contrary opinion; yea and that this <hi>necessity,</hi> which here Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> makes a <hi>principal Foundation of</hi> Christian <hi>Faith,</hi> lieth athwart and cross to his own words and notions else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>12</label> preceding) for any overplus of wisdom or reason in it. <hi>You have</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> here to me) <hi>already denied Gods determining the beginnings and periods of mens lives; and so have shaken the Doctrine of Gods Providence.</hi> Very possibly I may either by that Doctrine you speak of, or by some other, have <hi>shaken the Doctrine of Gods Providence,</hi> as it is form'd and taught by men of <hi>shaken</hi> brains. But for <hi>the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Gods Providence,</hi> as it is held forth and taught in the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65873:136"/> Scriptures by the Holy Ghost it suffers not at all by that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or <hi>denial</hi> of mine, of which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> here speaks, especially as this Denial is explained, limited, and cautioned by me. For Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> according to the saying, <hi>Dolosus versatur in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralibus,</hi> Persons that are wily, love to be in generals, still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports my opinions in general, unlimited, and unexplained terms, which in ordinary Readers is apt to beget a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent sense or notion of them, from mine. It cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Scriptures, that it was <hi>determined</hi> by God that <hi>David</hi> should commit adultery with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> or that he should commit it precisely at such a time; or consequently, that either the conception, or birth, of the childe begotten in this adultery, was <hi>determined</hi> by him. Nay, it may be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved from the Scriptures that it was not <hi>determined</hi> by God, <hi>viz.</hi> because it was severely prohibited and threatned by him in his Law. Do men forbid, threaten, yea and severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punish such actions or practices in men, which they necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatingly determine that they shall do, or purpose to compell them to do? Or is God less wise, or less gracious, or less righteous than men? But Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> representeth God unto the world from place to place in his Book, upon such unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy terms, that he maketh him, one while in wisdom, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while in goodness, another while in justice, beneath himself, at least beneath many other men. I shall onely (upon this account) propound a question or two to Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> briefly. Whether doth he think it would have argued any defect in <hi>Gods Providence,</hi> in case his Father had not married at all, or had not married his Mother, but some other woman, by whom (possibly) he might never have had any childe, and so Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> never have been born; or in case his Mother had not conceived at that very instant, when she did conceive him; or in case he had not been brought forth in that precise moment of time, wherein his Mother was delivered of him? If his answer shall be affirmative, (for if negative, he plainly non-suiteth himself, in his charge or indictment, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear presently) <hi>viz.</hi> that it would have argued a defect in Providence, in case any of these Particulars had not taken place under all these precise circumstances, with which they

If this argueth no defect herein, (for I presume he will acknowledg this) then would I learn from him, why or how it would more have argued any such defect as now we speak of, in case his father had never married, than the non-marrying of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny another man, who never marrieth. If his fathers non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marrying, and consequently his non-begetting any childe, as (for instance) Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> by name, would have argued no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in <hi>Gods Providence,</hi> then for any man to think or teach, that neither his marrying, nor his begetting Mr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> were <hi>determined</hi> by God, cannot be derogatory in the least from the honour or glory of his <hi>Providence,</hi> or any <hi>shaking</hi> to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> hereof: in as much as it cannot reasonably be imagined to be any defect in God, or in his <hi>Providence,</hi> not to <hi>determine</hi> the futurity of such things, which in case they should never come to pass, would reflect no dishonour, or disparagement in the least, either upon him, or his Providence. So then it is a plain case that neither the beginning of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> life, nor his begetting, or life it self, were <hi>determined</hi> by God; and consequently, that he who denieth them to have been thus <hi>determined,</hi> doth no ways <hi>shake</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> (I mean, the true and wholesome <hi>Doctrine</hi>) of the <hi>Providence</hi> of God. Besides, if God by the infinite perfection of his understanding, and all-comprehensiveness of his knowledg▪ certainly knew, that, and when, Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> father would of his own accord marry, and that, and when, his mother, according to the course of nature, would conceive and bring him forth, what occasion or need was there for God over and beyond such a knowledg, or foreknowledg, to pass an Act of <hi>Determination,</hi> either that, or when, he should be conceived and born? For that the knowledg, or foreknowledg of things future in God, is one thing, and his <hi>Determination</hi> of their futurity, another, is so well known to those who understand themselves, though but to the quantity of a grain of Mustard-seed, in these Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, that in reference (at least) unto them, there needs no proof of it. There is the self-same consideration of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65873:137"/> or continuation of the lives of men. It is proper to the Providence of God to take knowledg of all creatures and beings, when they are produced; and to provide for their preservation and continuance in being, and for their well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also, according to such rules, and with such limitations, exceptions, and provisions, in a thousand kindes, as his unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and incomprehensible wisdom and goodness do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and prescribe. This <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> both the Scriptures, Reason, and the Government of the World, do assert and teach; but for the Doctrine of <hi>Gods determining the beginnings and periods of the lives of all creatures,</hi> it is not to be found in any of these Books.

For is such a saying as this worthy the lips of a sober or discreet man; <hi>Whosoever of my Sheep shall not keep in my Fold, or Field, shall so long have no Pasture with his Fellows?</hi> Or is there any more savour or taste of wisdom or wit in it, than there

               <p>Besides, his Principles considered, this saying is as dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to that which here he puts upon the Evangelist, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels with it, as the Harp with the Harrow, or Chalk with Cheese.

               <p>First, Is this the method prescribed by <hi>Christ</hi> for preaching the Gospel, to <hi>try whether they can work men,</hi> suppose unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, <hi>to fear Hell,</hi> without giving them any <hi>hope of Heaven,</hi> [for to possess and fill unregenerate men with <hi>hope of Heaven</hi> upon their beleeving, is not to <hi>flatter them with an hope of Heaven,</hi> but to give them this hope upon the solid, clear, and express foundations of the Word of God] <hi>and onely to thunder and lighten against them, &amp;c.</hi> Wo be those that are blinde, and have Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> for their leader. When <hi>Christ</hi> sent forth the seventy Disciples, two by two, to preach the Gospel, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he sent them to preach it to <hi>unregenerate</hi> men. The method directed by him for the preaching it, is contained in these words; <hi>Into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.</hi> Do these words, <hi>Peace be to this house,</hi> signifie to <hi>thunder and lighten against</hi> those in the <hi>house?</hi> Or to <hi>raise tempest and storm upon them?</hi> So again, <hi>Into whatsoever City ye enter, and they receive you,</hi> [that is, admit or suffer you to preach amongst them] <hi>eat such things as are set before you: and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is come nigh unto you.</hi> But were the Disciples like to <hi>try</hi> whether they could <hi>work</hi> the men of the City <hi>to the fear of Hell,</hi> by saying unto them, <hi>The Kingdom of God is come nigh unto you?</hi> When <hi>John</hi> Baptist <hi>preached in the Wilderness of</hi> Judea, <hi>saying, Repent ye; for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi>

                  <hi>unregenerate</hi> men, as such, should have <hi>storm and tempest raised upon them,</hi> or be <hi>thundered</hi> against with the threatnings of Hell-fire, but as having rejected the Gospel, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great salvation therein tendered by God unto them.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65873:140"/>
                  <hi>How shall we escape,</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>if we neglect so great a salvation?</hi> According to the tenour of the Gospel, men are not to be threatned with damnation, but onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their refusal ot neglect of the salvation therein offered; or at most, in case, and upon supposition, of such their refusal. The King in the Parable of the Marriage-feast, did not threaten those whom he invited, before their invitation, nor untill they had rejected it: nor doth God order or allow his Ministers to thunder or threaten damnation against <hi>unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> men untill they have first preached his grace▪ and mercy unto them in the Gospel, and perceive that they cast them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde their back, and remain obdurate and impenitent. This method is of the Lord <hi>Christs</hi> own prescription to his Apostles, when he sent them forth with a commission and charge to preach the Gospel unto the world. <hi>And he said unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16.</note> The Gospel was first to be preached <hi>to every creature,</hi> [and if so, certainly to <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> men] and salvation to be promised, yea ensured, unto them upon their beleeving joyned with profession, before the <hi>storm and tempest</hi> of <hi>damnation</hi> was to be <hi>raised</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas M. <hi>K.</hi> rejoyceth over his own ignorance in this unsavoury jear; <hi>I perceive you rich men can afford ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unregenerate men hope,— much good may it do them; but I fear, &amp;c.</hi> opposing his own, and his parties practice hereunto, in these words, <hi>We will not flatter him with the hope of Heaven.</hi> First, when he termeth me <hi>a rich man,</hi> I know not whether he <hi>ironically</hi> upbraideth me with my poverty in comparison of his own, or his parties wealth, or whether he expresseth his envy at my supposed wealth, or whether his <hi>Ingeniolum</hi> pleaseth it self with some exotick crotchet in the word <hi>rich.</hi> But because the inquiry will hardly quit cost, or bear its own charges, I shall pursue it no further. But secondly, why should the good man be so sorely offended, that <hi>hope</hi> [of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation] should <hi>be afforded unto unregenerate men,</hi> in case they shall beleeve and repent? For never was there any <hi>hope af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded</hi>

Such <hi>hope</hi> as this is expresly afforded unto them by the constant and loud voice of the Gospel, and particularly by <hi>Christ</hi> himself, in that famous delineation or description of the Gospel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>So God loved the world that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whosoever</hi> [whether at present regenerate or unregenerate] <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> M. <hi>K.</hi> himself grants, that the Elect (as he calleth Elect) whom he will needs (right, or wrong) have here meant by <hi>the world,</hi> are for a time, yea some for a long time, <hi>unregenerate.</hi> And doth not <hi>Christ</hi> in the words now mentioned, <hi>afford</hi> a rich and pregnant <hi>hope</hi> unto all those signified by the word <hi>world,</hi> (whoever they be) that upon their <hi>beleeving [viz.</hi> persevering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly] they shall be eternally saved?

               <p>Fifthly, when he tells me, that I <hi>should onely thunder and lighten against such wretches, raise storm and tempest upon them, not lead them on with a Sun-shine, and open a door of hope unto them, &amp;c.</hi> I would gladly know of him, what influence or operation such addresments unto them as these, are like to have upon them, or to what frame and state of heart and soul they are like to reduce them? <hi>Fear of Hell,</hi> without some mixture of <hi>hope</hi> to escape, is nothing but absolute and pure despair, and this not onely, nor so much, of, or in, a mans self, or his own goodness, or strength, but in the grace, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and mercy of God also. And to bring or work men to a despair in God, and of his grace and mercy, is this <hi>to deal,</hi> or act, <hi>like a workman that needs not be ashamed?</hi> Or is it a thing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65873:141"/> commendable in any man, or sort of men, and not rather execrable in the highest degree, totally and absolutely to despair of the grace and mercy of God? Yet to work this despair in men, and consequently to render them most hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and abominable in the sight of God, is (it seems) a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the glory of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Ministery.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> will have <hi>no hope afforded</hi> unto <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi> men, by what means will he be able ever to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them, or help them out of their miserable and wretched condition: certain it is, that <hi>thundering and lightening onely</hi> will not regenerate them. Fear without hope (as was lately said) causeth men to despair; and despair driveth men to the greatest distance from God. Whereas Regeneration can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take place without a drawing near unto God, being, or implying, a communion with him in his nature. And this communion or participation with God in his <hi>divine nature,</hi> is (as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth us) effected or obtained by means of <hi>the exceeding great and precious promises</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, not by <hi>the thunder and lightening,</hi> not by the <hi>storm and tempest,</hi> of the Law. Therefore to say, that no hope is to be afforded to <hi>unregenerate</hi> men, whilest such, and to say, that there is no means for <hi>unregenerate</hi> men to become regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, are two sayings altogether parallel both in reason, and in truth. And are not these sad tidings for such of Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> Elect, who at present are unregenerate, and thus long (as himself determines the case against them elsewhere) <hi>not capable of salvation?</hi> He had need confess himself to be in an errour here, lest he confess himself to be in his sins; yea and so in his sins, as to be out of all hope of ever being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, (and lastly for this) even when a Minister of the Gospel, following his instructions, and duly observing the tenour of his commission, shall <hi>thunder and lighten</hi> against <hi>unregenerate</hi> and <hi>ungodly</hi> men, as <hi>viz.</hi> after they have rejected the Gospel, or neglected the great salvation tendered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in unto them, yea or have turn'd the grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness, he is not so, or upon such terms to <hi>thunder and lighten</hi> against them, as to <hi>afford</hi> them no hope or sense of a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65873:141"/> of salvation upon their repentance and beleeving, at least except it be known unto him that they are under the guilt of that sin, which is unpardonable. And since God himself in the Gospel promiseth salvation even to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of sinners, in case of their repentance, and consequently <hi>opens a door of hope</hi> unto them of being saved upon such terms, how can any man, who pretends to the high dignity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Minister of the Gospel, without sacrilege deny this <hi>hope</hi> unto such men, or shut the door against them, which God himself hath opened unto them? If Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> means as he saith in the passages of his Book now under examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (with their neighbours and fellows) he is a very great stranger to the minde of God in the Gospel. But I rather suppose that his Pen mistook his minde all along; and that his meaning onely was, that unregenerate and wicked men ought not to be fed with any the least hope of being saved, in case they shall continue impenitent and wicked unto the end. However, if this were his meaning, he hath egregious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abused, both his Reader, and his Adversary, in represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things unto the former in such a manner, as if they were denied by the latter. But I touch upon this else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ls of dishonour!</hi> If God might have made Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> and others vessels of dishonour, I demand, whether he <hi>might</hi> have <hi>done</hi> it, before, or after, or at the same time when he made them vessels of honour. He could not make them <hi>vessels of dishonour,</hi> before he made them vessels of honour, because this was done by him, (as Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> positively sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth) from eternity; and before eternity God was in no capacity of acting in one kinde, or other. After he had made them vessels of honour, he could not unmake them, (I still argue according to Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> principles) or make them vessels of dishonour: the Decrees of God are like unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, unchangeable. At the same time, when he made them vessels of honour, he could not <hi>justly</hi> have made them <hi>vessels
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65873:142"/> of dishonour.</hi> For, punitive first, <hi>justice</hi> hath place onely in case of demerit; but Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> had not demerited or sinned, more than he had a being, from eternity. Secondly, to be made a vessel of dishonour, is either penal to the creature so made, or not: If penal, then it supposeth sin preceding. But no sin could precede eternity, or the being of the sinner. If not, then the hatred of God, or the effects of this hatred, are not at all penal to the creature: For the making of a creature <hi>a vessel of dishonour,</hi> importeth, the separating of this creature by God from himself, (which is an act of hatred) unto the greatest of all punishments. Thirdly, if God might then have made Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> and others, vessels of dishonour, when he made them vessels of honour, then was there not onely <hi>Potentia activa,</hi> a power of acting in God, which argueth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but <hi>Potentialitas</hi> also, a power of being changed or altered in, or from, his present purposes or intentions; which importeth <hi>Potentiam passivam,</hi> and imperfection. For it cannot be supposed, that God might have done any thing contrary to what he hath done, but that it must be supposed withall, that he might have altered the purpose or intent which was in him, to act, as or what, he did act, or now hath acted, into a purpose of acting contrarily. Fourthly, (and lastly) if Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> being <hi>an unclean vessel naturally,</hi> was the ground upon which God might have <hi>justly made him a vessel of dishonour,</hi> (as here he plainly supposeth) then might God have made him <hi>a vessel of dishonour,</hi> long after he had made him <hi>a vessel of honour.</hi> For Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> was not <hi>an unclean vessel naturally,</hi> from eternity, but in time, yea a long time after that time had begun his race: but he was made <hi>a vessel of honour</hi> (as he calls making vessels of honour) from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65873:142"/> to elect, is to ordinary Logicians un-intelligible:</hi> Hath not the man a desire to be censed among <hi>Logicians extraordinary?</hi> Or doth he in such his profession imply, that <hi>how God should decree to elect,</hi> is to him <hi>unintelligible?</hi> If this be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is no great marvel that he is so inexpert, and shallow-sighted, and speaks so loosly and at random, in the questions and controversies traversed by him in his Book, it being a sufficient proof against him, that he understandeth not his own chief Authours. For these frequently use the notion, and several times the very expression, of Gods <hi>decreeing to elect.</hi> I remember Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> imputes the perplexed and disadvantageous handling of the Question or Doctrine of <hi>Reprobation</hi> by men of his side, (amongst other things) to their <hi>non-distinguishing accurately between the decree of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is from eternity, and the act of Reprobating, which is exercised in time after the Fall;</hi> and affirmeth, that <hi>many things which are proper to the act, sound very harshly when applied to the decree.</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Sex autem sunt quae mihi videntur praecipuè hîc difficultatem augere: Primò non accuratè distinguunt Doctores inter decretum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probationis, quod est ab aeterno; &amp; actum repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandi, quod in tempore post lapsum exerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

For (saith he further to his adversary <hi>Castalio) you must confess that God in time puts those things in execution, which he ordained</hi> [or decreed] <hi>before all time.</hi> According to the notion &amp; tenour of his interpretation of this place, he interprets others also of like phrase and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65873:143"/> As where <hi>Paul</hi> repeating the words of <hi>Malachi,</hi> saith, <hi>But</hi> Esau <hi>have I hated, (Rom.</hi> 9.13.) <hi>I say,</hi> (saith this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour) <hi>that the word</hi> Odi, <hi>I have hated,</hi> [signifies, or] <hi>declares nothing but, I have decreed to hate; in asmuch as</hi> Paul <hi>disputeth of the Decree of God, not of the execution</hi> [or acting] <hi>of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</hi> Thus likewise he expoundeth that of the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.—<hi>According to his own purpose and grace which was given us in</hi> Christ Jesus <hi>before the world began,</hi> that is (saith <hi>Beza) God purposed to give us his grace in</hi> Christ Jesus <hi>before all times were, which notwithstanding he doth not actually give us, untill he calleth us effectually</hi> [or with effect] <hi>unto himself.</hi>

               <p>These things considered, is it not (at least a little) strange, how so great a Clerk as Mr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> who takes upon him that grand undertaking of Defending the Faith of the Reformed Churches, should resent it as a matter of so high and difficult a speculation, as to require an extraordinary <hi>Logician,</hi> that is, a man equal to himself in this faculty, or perhaps superiour to him, to <hi>understand</hi> or conceive, <hi>how</hi> God <hi>should decree to elect,</hi> that is, how he should decree that from eternity, which he acteth or putteth in execution in time?

First, the absurdity it self (as he stiles it, and with cause enough) was the placing of his seventeenth Chapter immediately after his fourth, and before his fifth. But how was he by me <hi>necessitated</hi> to this unhappy Atopy? Because I did not preach my Sermon, before I had taken my Text, but afterwards; or (which is <hi>effective</hi> the same) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I did not declare and set down in what sense I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.

               <p>But my Book of Redemption, though erroneous (as Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> counts errour) or worse (in a manner) all over, yet was it not (it seems) a field large and fruitfull enough to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his wants of matters of exception against me; but his necessities in this kinde pressed him to search into my other Writings, and to seek for more of that treasure here. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving travelled (as is probable) from the East to the West of my Writings with an intense eye to discover something that was like to take a black Dye, and might be perverted to matter of disparagement against me, (at least in the thoughts of injudicious men, who are enough for M. <hi>Kendals</hi> purpose) at last, in my Epistle Dedicatory to the Parliament, before my Treatise of <hi>the Divine Authority of the Scriptures,</hi> he met with these words ensuing, to his great comfort on the one hand, and yet to his great trouble and offence (as it seems) on the other hand. <hi>I am not conscious to my self of the least wrong I have ever done, either to man, woman, or childe, either in

His trouble and discontent at a saying so innocent, (especially the occasion of the speaking of it, considered) inclineth me to suspect that his conscience taketh little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or comfort in it self, either in respect of any former, or of any present integrity. If there had been nothing more in the said passage, than what he thought himself had either attained unto already, or else were inwardly desirous to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, I make no question but it had passed by him, as it hath done by many others, with little or no observation; or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without exception, or reproof.

If this account be passable, the man (I confess) hath taken a round and ready course to quit himself (and this with credit sufficient) of the care and labour of answering any of my quotations, whether from ancient or latter Divines. But in the mean time hath he not made an hard and severe Law, both against himself, and his opinion, by which if they be judged, they will both be found deep in condemnation; the opinion, as not having any sufficient foundation in Scripture, nor any correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the judgment of any learned man, ancient, or modern; the man, for obtruding-such an opinion as this upon the world with so much height of an importune confidence, as he hath done? For where will he finde these words in Scripture, or in any of the said Authors, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath died for none, but for those who were elected under a meer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal consideration from eternity, and who shall have more cause to bless God in Heaven, than those shall, who shall be cast into Hell? To pretend or say, that there can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable ground to beleeve, that any Authour holds the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of general Redemption, unless these words can be <hi>shewed</hi> in his Writings, that <hi>God, or</hi> Christ, <hi>intended as much, effected as much, for them that perish, as these who are saved, so that they in Heaven have just as much cause to bless God, as those in Hell;</hi> what words soever may be found in him savouring of this opinion otherwise, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a most simple and sensless saying. Nor can Mr. <hi>K.</hi> nor all his Symmists, if this Rule be admitted, prove either that I, or any other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatsoever, hold general Redemption, in as much as such words as these are none of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:65873:146"/>
               <p>Nor doth it savour of much more profoundness, to say, (as Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> in effect, and as good as in so many words, saith in the place last remonstrated, and which, with the late spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified speculation, is the <hi>summa totalis</hi> of all that he answers, either to the Scriptures, or testimonies otherwise produced and pleaded by me for the avouchment of the Doctrine of general Redemption) that when either the Scriptures, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or late Writers affirm, that Christ <hi>died for all men,</hi> their meaning is, that <hi>he died for all sorts of men, and for all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men, so that his Death was sufficient for them.</hi> For first, neither do the Scriptures, nor very many, if any, of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cited by me, declare any such meaning intended by them in that saying. Nor secondly, is there any Principle in reason leading to such a meaning in such words. Now to put a sense or meaning upon any sentence of Scripture, other than what is either plainly and directly expressed in the words themselves, or elsewhere in Scripture declared to be the intended sense or meaning thereof, or else may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by some Principle in reason to be sense and meaning we speak of, is not to expound or interpret the Scriptures now in being, but to coin or create new Scriptures, and to obtrude them in the name of the other, upon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and consciences of men. Nor is it any whit more equal, though it be less dangerous, to interpret the sayings of men upon other terms. Thirdly, if Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that all those shall be saved, for whom <hi>Christ</hi> died, then cannot the meaning of, Christ <hi>died for all men,</hi> be, that <hi>he died for all sorts of men,</hi> no nor yet that he died for men of all sorts, (which had been much the apter expression for Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> sense; because to die for all men, and for all sorts of men, in ordinary Grammar-construction, is but the same, <hi>a sort</hi> or <hi>species</hi> comprehending all the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals or particulars under it) because it can never be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that some of all sorts of men, have been, or ever will be, saved. Yea in this very discourse it is some where proved, that there are some <hi>sorts</hi> or kindes of men, no individuals or particulars whereof shall ever be saved. Now that which is not in it self a truth, cannot possibly be the true sense or
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65873:147"/> meaning of any saying in Scripture. Fourthly, by <hi>Christ dying for all sorts of men,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> onely means, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a few, yea a very few (comparatively) of <hi>all sorts</hi> (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together.) Now where Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> will finde, either in Scripture, or in any good Authour, the word <hi>All</hi> used to signifie a few, an inconsiderable number of those spoken of in comparison of the rest, I confess I am to seek; and so I beleeve is Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> too. Fifthly, if Christ's <hi>dying for all men,</hi> imports his dying for all sorts of men (in Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> sense) that is, onely for some few men of all sorts; then it imports a disobligation in all men from beleeving in him. For first, his dying onely for some few of all sorts of men, supposeth these men, for whom he died, to be unknown amongst men, yea unto themselves, at least untill they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. Secondly, they who know not whether <hi>Christ</hi> died for them, or no, especially having ten times more reason to fear that he did not die for them, than that he did, (a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that cleaves as fast and close to Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as the skin to the flesh) can have no sufficient or stable ground (at least at first) to beleeve on him; nor (indeed) any such ground, on which the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly adviseth men to build their dependence and hope. But this I have argued more at large in my Book of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 467, 468, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Sixthly, Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> sense of the words and saying now in dispute, renders that Commission or Charge which God hath given to the Heraulds of his Grace (the Ministers of his Gospel) as <hi>viz.</hi> to proclame and offer salvation unto all flesh upon their beleeving in <hi>Christ,</hi> altogether unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him. To invite an hundred men to a Feast, and this with the greatest earnestness and importunity, with the greatest semblance of affection and good will towards them all, and profession of desire of their coming; and yet before, and under this invitation, to resolve, and make sure, that not ten of this number shall come, nay so to order and contrive matters in reference to farre the greatest part of them, that they shall be so farre from coming unto, or partaking of the Feast, whereunto they are invited, that they shall unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be tormented with the most exquisite torments that can
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65873:147"/> be invented, and inhumanely murthered, is a most wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and accursed Parable or Parallel, whereby to resemble the glorious Gospel of God. Yet according to Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> notion of it, and his sense of Christ<hi>'s dying for all men,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, concerning his second shift to evade the clear and direct sense of the Assertion, that Christ <hi>dyed for all men,</hi> whether found in the Scripture, or in other Authours, as <hi>viz.</hi> that the meaning is not, that <hi>Christ</hi> died intention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for all men, but <hi>sufficiently</hi> onely; this is so uncouth and harsh, that two of his <hi>Heroes</hi> or Demi-gods themselves, whose names are so sacred unto him, that at the very sound of them his manner is (it seems) to rise up and do reverence, (<hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Piscator</hi>) have not onely decried and rejected, but even stigmatized it, as <hi>barbarous</hi> and <hi>homonymous,</hi> yea the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, as absolutely false.<note n="a" place="margin">Pro Reprobis nullo modo mortuus est Christus, sive sufficienter dicas, sive ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciter.

Eighthly, (and lastly) when God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the World of his exceeding great grace, his most tender mercies towards it, by declaring that he gave his Son <hi>to death for all men,</hi> what do they, who make him to say no more herein, but onely this, that he gave that, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>sufficient</hi> to save, and bless them all, but he never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the one half, or fortieth part of them, should be the better for it, but very many of them the worse; what doth such an interpretation as this (I say) of so rich and gracious a saying from the mouth of God, but quite alter the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of it, and make the Trumpet of God, which gives a sound distinct and loud enough of grace and mercy intended unto the world, to sound hollow and hoarse; yea to give a distinct sound rather of an utter and absolute disaffection, and peremptory aversness in God to do any great matters for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65873:148"/> the World, than of any gracious or mercifull intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.</p>
               <p>What hath now been delivered in this Section, is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent refutation of Mr. <hi>Kendals long some Discourse,</hi> (as himself calleth it) and clearly sheweth, that what he hath pretended to answer, either to those Texts of Scriptures, or those other Authorities, on which I have built the great Doctrine of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Redemption, is (in his own Friends expression) but an Answer so called, and hath neither weight, worth, strength, or solidity in it.</p>
               <p>Whereas from those words <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. —<hi>but now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all men every where to repent,</hi> I argue, that all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commanded by God to <hi>repent,</hi> are commanded withall to beleeve on <hi>Christ,</hi> in as much as there is no true or saving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance without Faith in <hi>Christ;</hi> against this Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> excepts (among many other words, the taste whereof is as of the White of an Egg without Salt) these three things: First, that (indeed) <hi>God now commands men to repent of their ignorance and irreligion:</hi> but adds, <hi>So they may, and yet not beleeve on</hi> Christ. Secondly, that <hi>he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th not finde the Beleef here required to be so much a Beleef on</hi> Christ <hi>for salvation, as a Beleef that God will by him pass a Sentence of Condemnation on all such as shall persist in their ignorances and corruptions, in that which they call the Worship of God.</hi> Thirdly, that that <hi>repentance</hi> here commanded, is founded <hi>on a Beleef that God will condemn the World by</hi> Christ, <hi>if they repent not of these horrible wickednesses.</hi> But first, I thought that, according to Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Gods purpose and intent of <hi>condemning the World by Christ,</hi> had been subject neither to <hi>ifs</hi> nor <hi>ands,</hi> but every ways absolute, and the execution of it not suspended upon the uncertain motions of the wills of men in <hi>repenting,</hi> or not repenting. But his Principles (I perceive) have an inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating property in them, and I generally finde that men who drink them in,
<q>Haud aliter titubant, quam si mera vina bibissent.</q>
                  <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, neither doth <hi>Paul</hi> here preach <hi>Christ</hi> as a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> (Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> makes bold to mis-report the words of the Holy Ghost himself, and therefore I may patiently bear the mis-representation of mine by him) but as a <hi>Judg</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and this <hi>in righteousness,</hi> (&amp; the vulgar <hi>Latine</hi> reades, <hi>in aequitate,</hi> in equitie) which includes aswell his conferring of Salvation upon those, who shall repent and beleeve, as his <hi>condemning</hi> of those, <hi>who shall persist in their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and corruptions.</hi> Thirdly, evident it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> here preached the Resurrection of <hi>Christ</hi> from the <hi>dead, [in that,</hi> saith he, <hi>he hath raised him from the dead]</hi> and consequently, that his intent was, that this should be beleeved by those, to whom he preached it; and if beleeved, then confessed, or professed, also. Now it is a clear case, that truly and cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beleeve, (and surely <hi>Paul</hi> did not intend, or desire, that any worse kinde of faith than this should be given to his Doctrine by those, who heard it, though Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> hath an eye of such an absurditie as this, in the bulk of his Answer to the Scripture in hand) especially joyned with a sutable confession, that <hi>God raised up</hi> Christ <hi>from the dead,</hi> is a justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or saving Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. Fourthly, <hi>Christ</hi>'s rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing again from the dead evidently includeth and supposeth his death. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> preached this also unto the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Idolaters: and consequently required a sound beleef of it. Fifthly, (and lastly) it is at no hand probable, that <hi>Paul</hi> who was intrusted with the Gospel by God for the <hi>Gentile</hi>-part of the World, and who upon this account acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himself a Debtour both to <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> yea and who otherwise discovers himself again and ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in mightily intent and bent in soul and spirit upon the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the souls of men; it is not (I say) probable in the least, these things considered, that he should preach, and this at <hi>Athens,</hi> one of the principal Cities of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> at least of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> onely Judgment and Condemnation
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65873:149"/> by <hi>Christ,</hi> and not salvation. Therefore Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> conceit, that the <hi>Repentance,</hi> of which <hi>Paul</hi> here speaks, affirming it to be <hi>commanded</hi> by God <hi>unto all men,</hi> should be a Repentance, which may be <hi>without a beleeving in</hi> Christ, and <hi>without the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any man,</hi> is extremely atheological, and altogether unworthy a man who judgeth himself a <hi>super</hi>-monster of subtiltie, able alone to match, yea to overmatch, <hi>Pelagius, Socinus,</hi>

If I should say, Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> hath <hi>not so</hi> sufficiently <hi>enough</hi> discharged his undertaking in answering my Book, I suppose he would <hi>except</hi> against the phrase as well, as against the matter; and the truth is, it were much more exceptionable, than this. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> here affects the vain-glorious reward of such men, who (in <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s Proverb) are characterized as <gap reason="foreign">

The reason of the difference is, because <hi>a God,</hi> according to the import and force of the Particle <hi>[a]</hi> in such constructions in our <hi>English</hi> Tongue, signifieth <hi>God</hi> as so or so qualified, or disposed; whereas <hi>the God,</hi> according to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Particle <hi>[the]</hi> importeth only God in his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, or preheminence above, or amongst, all other gods. Thus when <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Thou wast a God that forgavest them;</hi> the emphatical meaning is, thou wast such a kind of God, as <hi>viz.</hi> so gracious, so merciful, <hi>&amp;c. that thou forgavest them,</hi> &amp;c. So when <hi>Esai</hi> saith, <hi>Verily thou art a God that hidest thy self;</hi> the Particle <hi>[a]</hi> giveth out some such sense as this (which questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onless is the genuine sense of the place) thou art <hi>a God</hi> so principled, a God acting, or moving by such Rules of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and righteousness in thy providential dispensations, that in such cases as those now before thee are, in reference unto us, thou art wont <hi>to hide thy self,</hi> that is, to withdraw the signs of thy presence for a time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Evident it is that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>[the]</hi> will not so clearly or properly raise such a sense as this. But Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> is so superstitiously officious to pluck

                  <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 127. Because I say, that many of those, who were invited to the Marriage-feast, and consequently for whom the Feast was prepared, never came to taste of this Feast, but were rejected and <hi>excluded</hi> from it with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> lifts up his horn of reproof with great indignation, and pusheth at my word, <hi>excluded,</hi> as if it were some monster of expression, that came ramping and roaring upon some darling notion of his, or other, to devour it. <hi>How you can</hi> (saith he) <hi>exclude a man out of your doors, that never meant to come within them, is more than will ever be included within mine and other vulgar understandings.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess there is not much roomth in Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> understanding; and therefore if I have offered him the incivilitie of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to oppress or overcharge his understanding by seeking to put more into it, than it will contain or hold, I shall repair him with the acknowledgment of my errour. But that the man is extremely addicted to childish and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cavilling, himself confesseth (upon the matter) in these words (a little before) <hi>The King indeed saith, They shall never taste of my Supper, but that is not an exclusion of them properly from the Supper.</hi> Why Mr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> did I say that they were <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded properly?</hi> But you saying, that they were not <hi>excluded properly,</hi> do you not plainly grant and implie, that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded</hi> they were? and what is this but my saying? I confess I do not alwaies speak <hi>properly;</hi> yea I easily beleeve that I
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65873:150"/> speak more figuratively, that is, <hi>improperly,</hi> (in Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> sense) than most other men. But neither doth Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> himself alwaies speak <hi>properly,</hi> witness his saying to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther College, that he <hi>presents unto her part of the plumes of an over-weening spirit to new-stuff the old Cushion of his learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours:</hi> (to omit many hundreds of other sayings in his Book of the same ignominious character of improprietie with this.) But why doth he not tax the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> also for using the word, <hi>excluded, improperly?</hi> Or is it to be taken <hi>properly</hi> in this saying; <hi>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of works? Nay: but by the Law of Faith.</hi>

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.</note> Doubtless it is as <hi>proper</hi> a saying of mine, that many of the guests invited were <hi>excluded</hi> from the Feast by this saying of the King, <hi>They shall never taste of my Supper,</hi> as it is for the Apostle to say, that <hi>Boasting is excluded by the Law of Faith.</hi> But yet by captious Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> good leave, it is no such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proprietie of speech to say, that <hi>they may be excluded out of a mans doors, who never meant to come within them.</hi> When Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> shuts the doors of his house in the evening, and keeps them fast shut all the night, doth he not as well <hi>exclude</hi> or shut out, those that never meant to come within his doors, as those who did? Nay in case it be supposed, that no man at all meant, within that time, to come within his doors, doth he not by shutting them <hi>exclude onely</hi> those, who <hi>never meant to come within them?</hi> Or when he so shuts his doors, doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>exclude</hi> or shut out no body, no person, or thing at all? Why then doth he shut his doors? But Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Book being so fraught as it is, with such quisquiliously-ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous stuff as this, must needs be tedious and wearisome above measure in the reading of it, to any sober and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man. Well might he say, (as he doth, entring upon the discourse now touched) <hi>This is somewhat yet, but this somewhat hath so much in it, as that by that time I have fully examined it, it will come all to just nothing,</hi> that is, to the same market, to which Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Book is <hi>come.</hi> If the passage of mine, of which he speaks, continues <hi>somewhat,</hi> untill he hath <hi>fully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi> it, I have no reason to fear the ever <hi>coming of it unto no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> That which a man understandeth not, nor is willing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65873:151"/> to understand, how should he ever <hi>fully examine?</hi> I cannot perceive all along Mr. <hi>Kendals longsome</hi> discourse, that he is so much as willing clearly and distinctly to understand the sense of his Adversarie, almost in any thing; but still noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth and conceiteth a counter or by-sense, and works upon this accordingly. However that facultie of which he here boasteth, <hi>viz.</hi> of bringing that which is <hi>something,</hi> by his handling it, <hi>unto just nothing,</hi> is no whit more commendable, than his skill is, who knows how to set an house on fire, and burn it into ashes, but knoweth not how to build one. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that Mr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> what by falsifying, what by curtailing, what by mangling, and transcribing my words brokenly and by piece-meal, taking and leaving as he pleaseth; what by mistaking, what by perverting and corrupting my sense and meaning from place to place, what by jumbling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding things by me clearly distinguished; in a word, what by waiwardness, and what by weakness, if my Book were to be estimated by his handling, or (as he calls it) <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining</hi> it, hath indeed brought it to <hi>just nothing,</hi> and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it into the similitude of his answer to it. So that Book and Answer (taking the former as mis-figured in the latter) seem to be a Conference or Discourse between two men distraught in their senses.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the words now touched, he declares himself either wilfully, or invincibly ignorant of my sense and meaning in a distinction of frequent and main concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the due understanding of the state of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between him and me, in these words; <hi>Howbeit you may safely speak of intentions precedent and subsequent in Kings, you may not be allowed to do so of God, his intentions being all eternal. And you who make him to act all by one act, and that eternal, of all other men should not ascribe to him variety of intentions, some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, others subsequent.</hi> Doth he not in this most frivolous and vain Exception against my Distinction of the intentions of God into <hi>precedent,</hi> and <hi>subsequent,</hi> evidently suppose, or at least endeavour to make his Reader suppose and think, that I hold some intentions in God to be precedaneous in time, or at least in nature, unto others? Whereas I declare my sense
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65873:151"/> touching the terms of the said distinction, quite otherwise, ansd this more than once, with as much plainess and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as words lightly can afford; particularly <hi>pag.</hi> 448. of my Book touching the said distinction, I deliver and explain my sense thus at large: <hi>The former of these is not called his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent will, or intention, either because it precedes the other in time, or in eternity, or in worth or dignity, or the like: no prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in any of these kindes hath place amongst the Decrees, wills, or intentions of God, which are all equally eternal, equally honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy of him. But the reason of this denomination is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is so ordered and cometh to pass by divine dispensation, that grace and means for the obtaining of salvation, are always in the first place vouchsafed unto men, before either salvation be actually conferr'd upon any man that beleeveth, or any thing penal (I mean, spiritually penal, or any ways tending to obduration, or condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) be inflicted upon unbeleevers, and much more before actual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction be brought upon them. So that the latter of the said two wills or intentions in God, is therefore termed, consequent, because he never acteth in order to, or with any tendency towards, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation or destruction of men but consequently to and after, such gracious actings of his, which were of a saving tendency and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port unto them, these being resisted, or rejected by them.</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction it self, as thus opened and understood, I afterwards shew and prove to be founded upon clearness and expresness of Scripture, in sundry places. So that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without question or controversie, that Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> either doth not understand plain <hi>English,</hi> or else wilfully and against conscience corrupteth himself in what he understandeth about my sense and meaning (thus by me expressed) touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>precedent</hi> and <hi>subsequent</hi> intentions of God. And to deny that I <hi>may be allowed,</hi> to ascribe <hi>intentions</hi> under this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction unto God, is to deny that I <hi>may be allowed</hi> to say, that <hi>Christ</hi> would have <hi>gathered</hi> Jerusalem's <hi>Children together, as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wing,</hi> before <hi>their house was left unto them desolate;</hi> or that <hi>Noah</hi> was <hi>a Preacher of righteousness</hi> unto the old World, before it was destroyed with a Floud; or that he gave <hi>Jezabel</hi> (in the Church of <hi>Thyatira) space to repent,</hi> before he <hi>cast her into a bed</hi> of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65873:152"/> and <hi>slew hir Children with death.</hi> And that the Scripture it self leadeth us, to the distinction of the intentions or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, into <hi>precedent</hi> [or, <hi>antecedent</hi>] and <hi>consequent,</hi> is not my sense alone, but the judgment also of as able Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours as I know any; yea and of learned antiquitie. <hi>The matter it self</hi> (saith <hi>Grotius) leadeth us to a diligent distinguishing between the Decrees of God. For some things God willeth antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, others consequently, or (as the most ancient</hi> Christians <hi>spake</hi>) upon, or <hi>by,</hi> that <hi>which followeth, or upon circumstance; which others term, secondarily.</hi>

But as Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> complains of his <hi>Ingeniolum, [i. e.</hi> his little wit] that sometimes it doth <hi>omnia nimia di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctione confundere,</hi> confound all with too much distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65873:162"/> so I am sure that otherwhile it playeth the same prank in a contrary method, and thorough want of distinguishing, <hi>confounds</hi> my notions and sayings, with the devised imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own fanciful brain.</p>
               <p>Immediately before the foul miscarriage of his pen last mentioned, he had contracted the like guilt, by avouching this also as my saying; <hi>Periods of mens lives not fixed by God.</hi> He tells the same false story over again, <hi>Part.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 1. My words, instead of which he substitutes these of his own, are these; <hi>Concerning the natural lives and beings of men in the world, neither is the continuance of these so absolutely or perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily fixed, or determined by God, but that either themselves, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, may either abbreviate or contract them, or else inlarge and protract them to a longer period, by means proportionable unto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> (with some others interpretative of these.) I perceive that if Mr. <hi>K.</hi> had a <hi>Contractors</hi> place, he would gain enough, though scarce honestly, by the imployment.</p>
               <p>Neither deserveth he any better than the shame of a man, that dealeth falsly, when <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>page</hi> 1. he chargeth me, that I <hi>have denied the necessity of Christs death.</hi> For when a man denieth a thing in such or such a sense onely, and with explication of himself in and about the denial; he that shall simply and positively say, that he denieth it, without so much as intimating the sense wherein, or those explications under which, he denieth it, is a slanderer and falsifier of that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he pretends to represent. As for example; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> should have said, as in effect he hath, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. that the ministration of the Law was not glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in respect of the ministration of the Gospel, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth [or, superaboundeth] in glory; should not he be a falsifier of his Doctrine, that should affirm, that he denieth the ministration of the Law to have been glorious? But (it seems) this kind of falsifying my opinions and sayings, is but a Grassehopper upon Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> conscience, the strength and stoutnesse whereof feeleth not the weight of it. I thus judge, because I find his book so full of it. But I may say of him in respect of this misdemeanour,

               <p>Towards the latter end of his seventeenth Chapter, (which, had he not been so <hi>easily necessitated to an absurdity,</hi> should, it seems, have been his fifth) he tempteth his Reader to believe these words to be mine (partly by transcribing them in his <hi>black letter,</hi> which elswhere he makes characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical of what comes out of <hi>Colemanstreet;</hi> partly also, and more plainly by this preface to them, <hi>And whereas you tell me) There is no other end for to be effected by the use of meanes of salvation, but salvation it self.</hi> But herein he tempteth him to believe an untruth, my words being these, <hi>There being no other end proper to be effected by the use of the means of salvation, but salvation it self; or at least none, but in conjunction with sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> This word <hi>proper,</hi> which layeth his whole Comment upon the rest of the words, in the dust, he suppresseth, and substituteth a word of his own: <hi>For,</hi> in the place of it, a word, which not onely holdeth no correspondence with my word <hi>proper,</hi> but also maketh the period it self to look as if it came out of <hi>Scythia Anglicana,</hi> so he termeth <hi>Cornwal,</hi> the place of his residence, and not out of <hi>Colemanstreet.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse of Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> I will say nothing: But if some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man should have misused my words thus, I might well have saluted him with

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65873:163"/> made all at first, you are the first I doubt who ever had the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to affirm.</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> I confesse is not the <hi>first,</hi> yet may well be numbred amongst the <hi>first-born</hi> of those, who unworthily deprave the sense and sayings of their adversaries. I no where say, that God <hi>actually made all at first,</hi> but on the contrary in many places teach, that things receive their <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> beings successively, and in time, though by vertue of the first great creative act of God. This passage of mine, which fully, though briefly, declares my sense touching the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in hand (and certain I am that there is nothing in my book contradicting it) was before Mr. <hi>K.</hi> in that very Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which he was hammering, when he committed that un-clerklike misdemeanour, of which I now complain. <hi>For we are not to conceive that upon the multiplication or new producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Entities, or beings, the Acts of God are multiplied, for, or in their production; but that whatsoever is produced by him, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives being from him (as all things that have being do) when, or at what time soever they receive this being, they receive it by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that one creative act of God, by which at once, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (as the Scripture phrase is) he gave being to all things.</hi> What can be more express and plain, than that in this passage I suppose and grant, that <hi>things receive their beings</hi> (which cannot be meant but of their <hi>actual beings</hi>) successively, and in time? as likewise, that when (in the cloze of the passage) I say, that God <hi>gave being to all things by that one creative act,</hi> (I spake of) my meaning onely is this, that God in and by this one act (which elswhere I teach to be indesinent, and interminable) did that, which gives them being, or <hi>actual</hi> being in time; herein speaking that frequent and familiar Dialect of the Scriptures, wherein he that acteth or doth that, which is apt and proper to produce such or such an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in time, or by which such an effect is produced in time, is said to have done the thing it self. Several instances hereof the Reader may find, <hi>page</hi> 187, 235, 239, 240. of my Book of Redemption. And whereas he pretends to <hi>doubt, that I am the first who have the confidence to affirm,</hi> what I do affirm, concerning Gods giving being to all things by that one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act, at which he so desperately stumbles; the truth is,

               <p>Nor doth Mr. <hi>K.</hi> incur any whit a lighter guilt of falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, when he maketh me to say [simply, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition] that <hi>all the Ancient Fathers were Arminians;</hi> my words (as to this point) being these; <hi>If the Opinions commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me for truth, in the work in hand, be Arminian, certain I am, that the Ancient Fathers and Writers of the Christian Church, were generally Arminian.</hi> Not to urge the far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing import of these two expressions, <hi>all the Ancient Fathers,</hi> and, <hi>the Ancient Fathers generally,</hi> (wide enough to evict him a Falsifier, that for the latter transcribes the former) doth he, who shall say, that if Mr. <hi>K.</hi> be a man of a tender and good conscience, he will not oppose the things of God which he understands not, therefore say, that Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> will not oppose the things of God in this kind?

He finds a forehead to tell his Reader, that in the seventeenth Chapter of my book, I say, that <hi>those who are damned, owe God as much, as those who are saved, as for whom God did as much, and to whom he intended as much, as to those who are saved;</hi> yea, these words he caused to be printed in the <hi>black letter,</hi> (as elswhere he calleth it) that so (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Caveat there given by him) they may be known to <hi>come out of Colemanstreet.</hi> Why hath <hi>Satan</hi> fill'd Mr. <hi>Kendaels</hi> heart to speak such untruths as this unto the world? Certain I am, that these are none of my words, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65873:165"/> in that, or in any other Chapter of my book; yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident I am, that he cannot find any one clause of the whole period, in the chapter he speaks of: But because so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with so much importunity, he burthens the Doctrine of General Atonement by Christ, as with a prodigious ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity, that it maketh the Damned as great debtors unto God as the Saved (for as for words of any such sound, they were never heard from me, nor read from my pen.) I shall take occasion here (once for all) to declare whether, and how far the Doctrine of Redemption, as it is asserted and held by me, is accessary to such a consequent; as also in what sense, or respect, the said consequent is an absurdity, and in what, none.</p>
               <p>First then, from Gods intentions of the salvation of all men by the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> it no wayes follows, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the damned are as great debtors unto him, as those who are saved. Nay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. From Gods intentions of giving unto all men a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of meanes of salvation upon the account of <hi>Christs</hi> death, the said pretended consequent doth not follow. The reason of the <hi>non-sequitur</hi> in both cases, is evident; <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God doth much more for those who are saved, than put them into a capacity of salvation by Christs death, yea, or than give them a sufficiencie of means for their salvation. For 1. unto those who are saved, besides a sufficiencie of means or power for believing, he vouchsafeth such an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal grace, by which they actually do believe, or come to believe, yea, and persevere, believing unto the end; neither of which, at least not the latter, are vouchsafed by him unto the others, I mean, those that are damned. 2. God confers the great blessing of actual salvation upon those who are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; whereas he inflicteth actual condemnation, or the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of eternal fire upon the damned. And will Mr. <hi>K.</hi> acknowledge, or think himself no whit more a Debtor unto God, for dividing him a portion with his blessed Angells, than he would have done, for <hi>cutting him asunder, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing him his portion with Hypocrites, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth?</hi> If not, is he not most worthy

               <p>To add a word about the latter particular mentioned;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65873:166"/> that the damned are in some respect, I mean, for some gracious and merciful vouchsafements granted unto them in their life time, as great debtors unto God (if yet being in a state of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they can properly be termed debtors for mercies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlie received) as many of those who are saved, is so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest a truth, [and consequentlie, far from being an absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or inconveniencie] that were it not for Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and those who have put the stumbling block of an un-man-like preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in their way, as he hath done, there needed no further proof or explication of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is nothing more apparent, than that <hi>Dives</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more abundantly from the hand of God in the good things of this life, than <hi>Lazarus</hi> did; and so likewise that many others, who perish eternally, have been more graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and bountifully entreated by God in the outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and contentments of this life, than many of those who are saved. Therefore it is none of the least of Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, to think it an absurdity, that the damned <hi>should</hi> (as he phraseth it) <hi>owe God as much</hi> (yea and more, in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and for some vouchsafements) as those that are saved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is as little question to be made, but that for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means of Grace and Salvation, many of those who are damned, owe God as much (in Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> phrase and sense) as many of those who are saved. No man reading and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21, 23. but will judge, that many (at least) of the Inhabitants of <hi>Chorazin,</hi> and so of <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> miscarried in the great businesse of salvation; and yet these (questionlesse) had greater external means (as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and his, love to speak) whereby to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, than that poor <hi>Canaanitish</hi> woman, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.22, &amp;c. whose salvation notwithstanding (I know) Mr. <hi>Kendall</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self questioneth not; yea <hi>Judas</hi> himself had a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of these means, than many; yea (it were but truth to say) than any (the rest of the Disciples only excepted) who are saved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither is it an hard saying, but a saying of soberness &amp; of truth, to affirm, that many, whose damnation we have cause in abundance to suspect, have received, and in these daies do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65873:166"/> from God as much, or more, inward enlightning, with the knowledg of the truth, as many of those who are saved: Therefore it is a clear case, that thus far the <hi>damned</hi> may (in Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> sense) <hi>owe as much to God, as those who are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And lastly, in case it should be said (which yet neither I, nor my opinion, say, either directly, or by consequence) that for inward means of believing (and so of being saved) the <hi>damned owe as much to God</hi> (as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> counts owing) <hi>as those that are saved:</hi> neither am I able to apprehend any great hardnesse or inconvenience in the saying. Certain I am, that such a saying, renders the damned highly inexcuseable, and consequently abundantly vindicateth the Justice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Gods proceedings in their condemnation; as also the riches of his Grace and Mercy towards them in the daies of their flesh. Nor doth it render his Grace unto those that are saved any whit defective; for that Grace of God, by the energie and operativeness whereof, men are not onely ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to obtain so inestimable a blessing, as Salvation is, but do likewise actually obtain it, is not disparageable, or lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Imputation of any deficiencie, by any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatsoever, nor particularly by this, that a larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of it hath been vouchsafed by God unto some, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse have turned it into wantonness, and rendred themselves so much the more inexcusable, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation so much the more insupportable by it. If God by the hand of his Providence should cast a thousand pound <hi>per annum</hi> upon Mr. <hi>K.</hi> were he, or should he be ever a whit the lesse debter unto the grace and bounty of God towards him, in case he should bestow two thousand pound <hi>per annum</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another.</p>

               <p>Evident it is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> in the contexture of Scriptures, from whence Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> citeth his instance, of <hi>a time to be born, and a time to die,</hi> speaketh not of a precise fixation of times by God, for all particular actions and events, but of a seasonableness, conveniencie, or commodiousness of times relating to every action and event, in respect of such and such circumstances, which commodiousness of time God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes observeth for his providential actings, and men, by his example, ought to observe for their actions likewise. This appears from that general Preface which <hi>Solomon</hi> prefixeth to all his particular instances, in the beginning of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter: <hi>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven,</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Eccl. 3.1.</note> meaning, 1. that there is no providential event, or thing which cometh to passe by the more appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or immediate interposure of God in the world, but he still effecteth it, all circumstances duly considered, in the best, most opportune, and seasonable time; and 2. that there is no regular purpose, or lawful businesse intended by men, but that there is a seasonablenesse of time for the transaction of it likewise, which men ought by a prudential consultation had with all circumstances relating to every such businesse respectively, narrowly to observe, and imbrace accordingly.

But why (Mr. <hi>K.</hi>) should they be <hi>strange creatures</hi> which were <hi>made without Gods determining,</hi> more, or rather, than those, which are made with it? Is God
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65873:172"/> lesse able to give regular and due shapes or proportions, or worthy and excellent endowments to his creatures, for want of <hi>determining</hi> whether they shall be made at such or such a minute or moment of time, then he would be upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a <hi>determination</hi> in this kind? Or doth the wisdom, power, or goodnesse of <hi>God</hi> depend in their actings upon his <hi>determining</hi> the precise point of time, when every particular person of mankind shall be begotten, or born into the world? Or are not the wisdome, power, or goodness of <hi>God,</hi> of themselves able to raise and frame what kind of creatures, both for nature, shape, and properties, in every kind, as he pleaseth? When Mr. <hi>K.</hi> thinketh nothing in the morning of eating his dinner about noon, doth this disable him from eating with his mouth, or from eating after the same manner, according to which he eateth, when he resolves upon his dinner as soon as he is waking? What an antick conceit is it to suspend the operation of <hi>Gods Power</hi> in forming creatures, upon his <hi>determining</hi> the punctual time, when they shall be formed? However, I do not speak of <hi>Gods making creatures without determining,</hi> but of a <hi>non-determination,</hi> or <hi>non-necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Parents</hi> to their <hi>generation.</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> may, if he please, believe that <hi>David</hi> was necessitated by <hi>God</hi> to that act of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> by which the child, which soon after died, was begotten; but I shall not believe it, untill Mr. <hi>K.</hi> shall substantially prove it, a task that (I suppose) will hold him <hi>us{que} ad Calendas Graecas.</hi>

Mr. <hi>K.</hi> may have an horse given him at such a time, when he expecteth no such gift: but it doth not follow from hence <hi>of course,</hi> that therefore when he hath him, he should part with him he knows not
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65873:173"/> when, or how. Nor doth Mr. <hi>K.</hi> (I presume) decree, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that his Ewe-sheep (of which he somewhere in his book tells a story to very little purpose) shall at such or such a time bring him forth lambs; yet when they have thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched him, he looks after his new increase, takes accompt of his lambs, and either suffers them to live, takes money for them, or serves his Table with them, as he pleaseth.</p>
               <p>Besides, this is as wild a consequence as can (lightly) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon paper: <hi>Parents are not necessitated to the generation</hi> of their children; therefore their <hi>children owe their present life chiefly to their Parents,</hi> yea, <hi>onely to their Parents, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God at all.</hi> For do children in this respect onely <hi>owe their lives unto God,</hi> because he <hi>necessitates their Parents to their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</hi> If Mr. <hi>K.</hi> cannot convince the consciences of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this <hi>necessitation</hi> of their Parents by <hi>God,</hi> (and they had need be very easie of conviction, who shall be found ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this accommodation from him) his Doctrine in this behalf casteth a snare of death upon them, and teacheth them horrid ingratitude unto <hi>God,</hi> perswading them out of all sense and thought, of their being debtors, in one respect or other, unto him for their lives. <hi>Children owe their lives chiefly unto God,</hi> because though he did not <hi>necessitate their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents unto their generation;</hi> yet 1. he contributed more (I mean that which is more excellent, and which requireth a far high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hand to contribute it) towards their being, then their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents did by their generation of them. 2. That which their Parents did in this kind contribute towards their being, rhey were inabled unto it by <hi>God.</hi> But these things (I confesse) are somewhat too obvious and neer at hand to entertain a Reader desirous of increase of knowledg.</p>
               <p>It is fit likewise that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> should be called upon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, from what Doctrine, notion, or words of mine, he haleth or drags this consequence, that men <hi>owe the future life to themselves, not unto God.</hi> I fear Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> may be inrolled amongst <hi>Plato</hi>'s Sophisters, whose character it was, <gap reason="foreign">

Or can Mr. <hi>K.</hi> put to rebuke this useful and true rule for the right interpretation of several Scriptures, delivered by some very able Expositors? <hi>Saepe de uno diversis modis considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

                  </note> We often speak of one [whether person, or thing] diversly considered, as of two. It is much, if Mr. <hi>K.</hi> the facetiousness and pleasantness of his <hi>Genius</hi> considered, were not somewhat theatrical, and addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to scenical recreations in the University. If he were, it is yet somewhat more, that he should not know, that one and the same Actor may represent two several persons, come up in two, or more, different habits, and act more parts then one in the same Comedy, or Tragedy. And a Parable is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlike unto such a contrivance, or device, as one of these. But to come up and joyn issue with <hi>Mr.</hi> K. in his Plea; why may not <hi>Christ,</hi> in respect of his death, or cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion, be signified by the <hi>Oxen and Fatlings slain,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that other consideration of him in the Parable, which he suggesteth? yea, why may he not, in <hi>Mr.</hi> Ks. own Dialect, be, or signifie, the <hi>preparations made for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the guests,</hi> or at least the principal and most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of these <hi>preparations?</hi> And it had been more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and proper for <hi>Mr.</hi> K. to have said, that the <hi>Oxen and Fatlings</hi> were the chief or principal of the <hi>preparations made for the entertainment of the guests,</hi> then simply, that they were, or are <hi>these preparations.</hi> For I believe, that neither <hi>Mr.</hi> K. nor any of his friends, were ever at any such feast, for the making or furnishing whereof <hi>Oxen and Fatlings only were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,</hi> or without some other additional <hi>preparations</hi> besides. And if <hi>Mr.</hi> K. can, and will resolve me, that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better and more desirable, or considerable, then <hi>Christ</hi> himself, and his presence, together with the enjoyment of him, amongst the <hi>preparations made for the entertainment of the guests,</hi> in the Parable, then I shall see ground to acknowledge my self to have <hi>slipt</hi> (as he counts <hi>slipping</hi>) in conceiving the death of Christ, or Christ crucified, to be signified by the <hi>Oxen and Fatlings</hi> slain. But who knoweth not, but that 1. <hi>Christ</hi> by his death prepared a way for the children of men to obtain the greatest felicity of which they are capable? And 2. that <hi>Christ</hi> being completely enjoyed, is the most sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and desirable point; or part, of this felicity? <hi>To him that overcometh</hi> (saith <hi>Christ</hi> himself, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.26.) <hi>will I give
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65873:175"/> power over the Nations.—And I will</hi> [further, and as a more considerable gift] <hi>give him the morning star,</hi> [meaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in full fruition and enjoyment] as himself interprets the metaphor, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.16. <hi>I Jesus have sent mine Angel— I am the Root and Off-spring of</hi> David, <hi>and your bright, and morning star.</hi> Now it is a clear case, that the persons unto whom, under the character or notion of Conquerours, <hi>or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomers,</hi> Christ promiseth himself, or the fruition of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, under the metaphor of the <hi>morning star,</hi> are the same with the <hi>guests entertained</hi> at the marriage-feast of the Kings Son, in the Parable. Thus the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> more then once, expresseth the <hi>entertainment</hi> which he expected and desired, at this feast, being a prime guest here, by his <hi>being with Christ. For I am in a strait</hi> (saith he) <hi>between two, having a desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and to be with Christ, which is far better, Philip.</hi> 1.23. And else where: we are <hi>confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. So likewise he expresseth the general <hi>entertainment</hi> of all the guests admitted to the <hi>feast</hi> we speak of, by their being <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with the Lord [Christ] — and so shall we be alwayes with the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.17. Thus then we see, that for a man to make, or take a streight step in the way of truth, is a <hi>slip,</hi> and this an emphatical one too, with Mr. <hi>K.</hi> His <hi>slip</hi> or mistake, at such turns as this, is dangerous indeed.

This strange providence happening in the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65873:175"/> said Chappel, whilest an Independent Minister and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation were performing their worship and service there, Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> supposing the said sound to have been made by an invisible drummer, beating a march up and down the Chappel, and consequently, mysteriously significative, gives his judgment of the businesse in these two grave prophetick observations, or admonitions. <hi>First</hi> (saith he) <hi>this passage of Providence speaks thus much to the Independents, and to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that the Independents are for war, desirous of war, and thirst for a new war with</hi> Scotland, <hi>&amp;c. Secondly, that the wars which they would have, and occasion, shall prove their ruine, the meanes to overthrow all their Conventicles, &amp;c. and cast them out of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>for ever, as the Bishops and their Faction were greedy for a war against the Scots, &amp;c.</hi> Thus far Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that strange prodigy, a poor dogs over-scratching his ear, and with the superfluity of the motion of his feet, beating an imaginary march upon the sounding side of a pew.

But with what gravity and solemnity of devotion on the one hand, with what importunity of fancy &amp; conceit on the other hand, doth Mr. <hi>K.</hi> insult over this poor harmless mistake, as if this had been the first time that ever any man, either in writing, or printing, had misplaced, or mis-printed one word for another?

One describing the <hi>Genius</hi> of our common Sea-men, saith, their manner is to be calm in a storm, and to storm in a calm. Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> manner (it seems) is to be very serious and weighty in a light matter, but to be joculatory and light in matters most serious and weighty. But doth <hi>M▪</hi> K. in good earnest judge, or think, that to mistake one word for another in writing, (yea, or in printing it self, when the mistake must needs in reason be more argumentative of the two) argueth <hi>a spirit of slumber falling upon a man,</hi> or that he that mistakes on either hand, is a man who <hi>setteth his wits against God?</hi> or that he <hi>pompously displayeth his folly</hi> in such a mistake?

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65873:176"/> making him to stumble so foully in a plain way, where</hi> Balaams Ass <hi>may see the hand of the Angel against the Prophet.</hi> Who <hi>M.</hi> K. means by <hi>Balaams Ass,</hi> I cannot well conjecture; I suppose no man <hi>sees,</hi> nor pretends <hi>to see,</hi> any <hi>hand of the Angel</hi> he speaks of against me (whom I suppose he means by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>) in that trivial mistake, but himself. If I had a mind (as it seems <hi>M.</hi> K. hath) to seek after mysteries in common mistakes and oversights amongst men, I could find better ground in his inconsiderate bringing up <hi>Balaams Ass</hi> upon the stage of his discourse, upon such terms, thar no man but himself can reasonably be signified by it, to <hi>adore the hand of God in infatuating</hi> him, then he hath found any in my writings for the like devotions in him, in reference unto me. And why doth not Mr. <hi>K. adore the hand of God in infatuating</hi> all his Printers, who in Printing his Books have <hi>stumbled,</hi> and this ten times over, more foully then I, or my Printer, have done, and in every whit <hi>as plain a way?</hi> And if I should but a little indulge my self in Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> humour of curious observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the infirmities and deficiences of men, I could without much ado arrive at this confidence, that God, by permitting Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Book to look out into the world with such a foul face, with so many monstrous and numerous deformities from the press, intended to give an overture unto the world, that it abounded with errours of a worse nature and import. And again, that by permitting so many of these Typographical errours to escape Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> correction and amendment, he gave this intimation, that Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with many foul and erroneous opinions in the points handled in his book, of which he will never repent, or be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from. But I leave Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> to build upon such quick-sands as these: the oversights or infirmities of men sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie little or nothing unto me, but onely that they, in whom they are found, are men un-risen from the dead. And whereas he chargeth me to be a man who <hi>set my wits against God,</hi> he doth but like himself, and according to the <hi>Genius</hi> of all those who deifie their own fond notions &amp; conceits, &amp; with those, themselves: and in the heat of this self-deification, give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against all those as <hi>fighters against God,</hi> who, though out
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65873:177"/> of a most genuine and wel-grounded zeal for the honour and exaltation of the Name of God, abhor their notions, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to detect the vanity and impiety of them. I fear, that when the day of righteous judgment cometh, not I, but Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> will be found the man, who <hi>setteth his wits,</hi> such as they are, or, the remainder of them, <hi>against God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I have again for a while sufflaminated the wheels of Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> triumphant chariot: he hath yet a good part of his race of rejoycing over the poor <hi>Consequent</hi> and <hi>Antecedent</hi> mistaking their places, to run. His next advance then is this: <hi>Would any man think that so great a Doctor should be to seek of the difference between the Antecedent and Consequent, that every fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should be able to point at him for an absurditie? This is the case at present. I desire you Reader but to review his arguments and see whether he put not the Antecedent for the Consequent, and the Consequent for the Antecedent: so the cart goes before the horse</hi> [as Mr. Ks. <hi>empty coach runs before his six Barbary horses</hi>

Is he not much better qualified for an office <hi>a jocularibus</hi> about some Earthly Prince, then for that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>in sacris</hi> about <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> which he hath taken upon him? I beleeve that <hi>ab orbe condito</hi> there was never such a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pageant plaid by any sober and considering man, as that presented by Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> to the worlds view in this place. He <hi>adores the hand of God for infatuating me:</hi> so Mr. <hi>Edwards ador'd the hand of God</hi> for the dogs foot beating a march so perfectly upon the board of a pew, to admonish Independent Ministers and Churches of the evil of their way. It is a light matter (it seems) with these men thus to take the Name of God in vain. The truth is, that I (with <hi>David) tremble at the judgment of God</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> and men of his notions and principles, who whil'st (with the <hi>Pharisees</hi>) they indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-wise demand, <hi>are we also blind,</hi> stumble, over and over at such truths which are written (as it were) with a Sun-beam

That it was either the same, or some other lavish and unruly tongue, one, or more, like unto it, that touch'd the learned spleen of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Vice-chancellor (otherwise, my Friend Doctor <hi>John O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen</hi>) and put him upon that dishonourable trouble of writing, <gap reason="foreign">

The like may be observed in that keen piece written against the truth for my sake by a person unknown to me altogether, save onely by the Name of <hi>Obadiah How,</hi> and a little tast of an over-confident spirit ruling there. <hi>Sed haec obiter.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> upon the <hi>clifts of Dover:</hi> but why he should say, I went here <hi>for a Giant Hog-magog,</hi> I beleeve that all King <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> Magicians, Astrologers, Sorcerers, and Chaldeans, were they present, would not be able to ariolate or divine, or give any rational interpretation of the dream.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:65873:179"/>
               <p>And to me, his meaning in his <hi>Cornish-hugg</hi> is well nigh as mystical, as in his saying, that I go for <hi>a Giant Gog-magog, upon, &amp;c.</hi> In process of his present discourse, and in the very next page (save one) he talks of <hi>stammin peticoats:</hi> I can better understand how he might have given a <hi>Cornish-hugg</hi> to one or more of these, then how he hath given any such thing to me. Onely by the scope of the place (in part) the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a lofty vapour, and partly by the words following <hi>[let others judg how near you have tumbled over and over]</hi> I guess that by giving me a <hi>Cornish-hugg,</hi> he means somewhat like to a worsting of me, or somewhat of a more glorious import to him, in the business last under debate. But (by the way) doth not Mr. <hi>K.</hi> much against himself, and the credit of his book, to call in men to <hi>judge</hi> of things in it? Alas! his book is calculated for persons of a wide swallow, of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous digestion and without chewing, for those that are facil in beleeving, strong in presuming, weak in examining, free in consenting. His notions look better, and shew fairer by the twilight, then by the light of the noon-day: an exact judgment is as the shadow of death unto them. But what may he mean by my <hi>near tumbling over and over?</hi> Doth he mean, that I have once <hi>tumbled,</hi> or <hi>tumbled over,</hi> and was near <hi>tumbling</hi> twice over and over? whatsoever the mans meaning be here, he hath dealt but unkindly by it to put it into such bad <hi>English.</hi> For who can judge what he hath to do, who is to <hi>judge how near I have tumbled?</hi> By what law or rule shall his Reader be able to <hi>judge</hi> in the case? Or if I was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>near tumbling,</hi> and yet did not tumble, it is a sign that I kept my ground somewhat better then Mr. <hi>K.</hi> when he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly disputed for his degree of Doctorship. It was well for him that he had M. Vice-Chancelor, and the two Divinity-professors, to Friend.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65873:179"/> But in the mean time <hi>by washing</hi> of soyl from them, which by me was never cast upon them, he hath defiled himself.

Why had you not named some one or other of the Reporters!

But I pray, if I may <hi>well be taken for a forger of the slander</hi> (if yet <hi>a slander</hi> it be, a proviso, which would have done neither your credit, nor your conscience any harm, to have inserted, rather then positively to have concluded it <hi>a slander,</hi> not knowing it whether it were such or no) because <hi>I name no Reporter</hi> of it, may not you by the same Law, be <hi>well taken for the forger of that slander</hi> of me, which you mention, p. 105. without naming so much as any <hi>one Reporter of it;</hi> viz. Where you say, that you <hi>have heard</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwin charged with dishonesty, in many of his quotations which follow?</hi> But (sure, more then enough) you are the <hi>forger of that slander,</hi> which present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here follows, <hi>viz.</hi> When you affirm that all <hi>my quotations of the ancients are taken from</hi> Vossius. This is as broad-fac'd an untruth, as it would have been in case you had reported a letter dated from <hi>Higham,</hi> which was dated from <hi>Blis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> For there is not a word of my first quotation from <hi>Ireneus,</hi> to be found in <hi>Vossius:</hi> neither doth <hi>Vossius</hi> so much as point to the place in this author, where that which I cite from him is to be found. Nor is there a word of either of my two next <hi>quotations,</hi> which are from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> extant in <hi>Vossius.</hi> Onely he points to the book, or Tract, in this Author, where the said quotations stand. But this no wayes proves that they were taken from <hi>Vossius;</hi> nay it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that they were neither of them taken from him; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less things may be said to be taken from such a place where
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65873:180"/> they never came. My first and principal quotation from <hi>Chrysostome</hi> yet further evinceth Mr. <hi>K.</hi> of the high crime of pseudologie. For it is so far from being true, that this quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was taken from <hi>Vossius,</hi> that there is not the least glimmering of light given by him where to find it, or any clause in it. My third and fourth <hi>quotation</hi> from this Father, joyn in the same verdict against Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and I know not how many more of those which follow. He hath sold both his credit &amp; conscience now these ten times over, &amp; hath taken a very despicable price for them, even nothing but the un-hallowed pleasure of telling so many un-truths. For though his counterfeits should pass for currant coyn, yet would not his cause be at all enriched hereby. For in case it were true, that all my <hi>quotations of the Fathers were taken from Vossius,</hi> would this alter their property, or keep them from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with their full weight and authorities upon the head of Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> cause? So that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> practiseth that which himself somewhere calls <hi>grollerie,</hi> upon more ignoble terms, then are commended unto him, (and others of the same occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) by him that said;

               <p>But Mr. <hi>K.</hi> hath sold his birth-right of credit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for somewhat less then a morsel of bread: and hath here (and elsewhere) made himself an unhappy exception, to that which a wise man took for a general rule: <hi>Nemo tam deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis est moribus, ut animi causa malus sit:</hi> there is no man so bad, as to do evil meerly because he hath a mind to do it. Never had I to do with any man pretending in the least to Religion, but kept a better watch before the door of his lips, then Mr. <hi>K.</hi> But that telling so many notorious gross and palpable un-truths as I have already detected, and taken him tardie with, he hath made so great a breach upon my opinion
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65873:180"/> of his honesty, that I am in no capacity to beleeve him hereafter, no not when he speaketh truth. Nay, he hath not left me wherewith to give credit to any thing he shall say, unless I have the help and advantage of a better voucher then his affirmation. But return we to his triumphant vindication of the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> Speaking of the words mentioned, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I expresly disclaim al credence and consent to that report, which chargeth this Synod with an oath of the tenour specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he riseth up in the might of his indignation, thus. <hi>The first arrow which you shoot against it; though it wants an head, yet it wants not poyson, and that such, as there is but one man alive, at least of this nation, that could possibly have furnished us with an antidote against it. Quam insipida &amp; insulsa haec omnia!</hi> For</p>
               <p>First, In case Mr. <hi>K.</hi> were famed abroad for too much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with any of those <hi>stammin peticoats</hi> he speaks of, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> should I <hi>shoot an arrow against him,</hi> especially a <hi>poyson'd arrow,</hi> in case I seriously and plainly professed that I did not believe this unhandsome fame of him? Is the man, and his sences parted, that he reasoneth at no better rate then this? If my falling out with that infamous report against the <hi>Synod</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, moved his choler, or caused the over-flowing of his gall, what would my falling in with it have done?</p>
               <p>Secondly, His rhetorick here is a meet correspondent for his Logick, and shameth it not. For how many <hi>poyson'd ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows</hi> hath Mr. <hi>K.</hi> observ'd, or heard of, that wanted <hi>heads,</hi> and yet were <hi>shot</hi> with an intent to wound, or do mischief? <hi>A poysoned arrow shot</hi> without <hi>an head,</hi> needs no such magnifick <hi>antidote</hi> against the danger of it. The truth is, though there be neither <hi>head</hi> nor foot in this indictment here drawn up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me; yet there is more of that which he calls <hi>poyson</hi> in it, then in the <hi>arrow</hi> he speaks of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, (and lastly) whereas, describing the deadly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulencie of his imaginary <hi>poyson,</hi> he tells us it is <hi>such,</hi> that <hi>there is but one man alive, at least of this nation, that can furnish us with an antidote against it, suatim loquitur,</hi> he speaks like himself in the premises. For if the <hi>poyson</hi> he speaks of were <hi>poyson</hi> indeed, and not in conceit onely, or whether it be the one, or the other, the <hi>one man</hi> he means <hi>of this nation,</hi> is so far
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65873:181"/> from being able or competent <hi>to furnish us with an antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it,</hi> that his <hi>Recipe,</hi> in case it be indeed his, which M. <hi>K.</hi> hath Printed in his Name (for M. <hi>K.</hi> pen is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poetical) is of small value for such a purpose. For one much greater then Doctor <hi>Hall,</hi> speaking of himself, and of his own testimony concerning himself, yeilded this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his enemies; <hi>If I bear witness of my self, my witness is not true</hi> (John 5.31.) meaning, that it was not legally true; or valid in Law, nor simply as such, or without the aid of some special circumstance or consideration, one or more, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of belief in any man. And for this reason the High Priests endeavoured to prevail with <hi>Pilate,</hi> to alter the <hi>title</hi> which he had <hi>put on his cross</hi> in this form, <hi>Jesus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth the King of the Jews,</hi> and to write instead of it, <hi>Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> who said, <hi>I am the King of the Jews. Write not</hi> (say they to <hi>Pilate) the King of the Jews, but he said, I am the King of the Jews</hi> (John 19.21.) thinking by this alteration, and by making himself the Proclaimer or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertor of himself to be this King, to elevate, or way lay the truth of his being King, in the minds and opinions of the people. If Mr. <hi>K.</hi> with six or seven men more were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended upon suspicion of felonie, and accordingly put in hold, in order to their trial at their next assizes, in case all the rest should die in prison before the assizes come, would Mr. <hi>K.</hi> be the <hi>onely man alive to furnish us with an antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the poyson</hi> of the indictment drawn up against him (with the rest,) and this by his bare, though never so confident, disclaming of the fact laid to his charge? Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Hall</hi> (we know) was a member of the <hi>Synod,</hi> and admitted to sit in it. Therefore in case any thing unworthy or dishonourable, were, or had been, through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailtie or weakness, yeilded unto by these mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to render themselves capable of the honour of sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting here as members (which misprision experience in like cases sufficiently proveth even good men to be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto) is it reasonable to authorise them for their own compurgatours in the case?</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:65873:181"/>

               <p>Yet this is Mr. <hi>Ks. witness without exception:</hi> yea and all the witnesses he hath, or at least produceth, to wash his beloved Synod clean from the dishonourable tincture of the Report, which he propagates and spreads further by his importune and needless contesting with it. In all this I am far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the Name or memory of that Bishop, whom Mr. <hi>K.</hi> brings up upon the stage of his book, in the habit or notion of an Apothecary with his Antidote of a singular and soveraign vertue to preserve the credit of the <hi>Synod of Dort</hi> from being destroyed by <hi>poyson.</hi> The hardest construction that can reasonably be made of any thing I have said of him, amounts to no more, then any other mans saying of him, that He was a man, would do. For Mr. <hi>K. Sancti Sanciti</hi> are not so far apotheized or deified by him, but that he yeilds them lapsible, notwithstanding any decree of God, into mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of a far worse import, then any thing suggested by me concerning the said Bishop. And to deliver my sense candidly and clearly concerning the man; He was amongst his fellow-Lord-Bishops (as far as I am able to make the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate) <hi>nulli secundus:</hi> he had as much, (or more) Christian worth in him, as was ordinarily found in his Order: he did as little harm with his rod of Episcopacy (as far as I have heard of him) as any other armed with the same weapon, did; the goodness of Lord-Bishops (as such) being alwayes estimated by me, not by any positive service done by them either to God, or good men, but by their refraining of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from troublesome and vexatious practises against god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, innocent, and well deserving men, and from countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing vanity and profaneness. And I interpret the providence of God towards him in putting it into his mind to withdraw from the Synod, before it came to be insnared with that sad
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65873:182"/> guilt of condemning the righteous, as remunerative of his equanimity in his Lordly office of a Bishop. Nor do I find his Name subscribed <hi>inter Magnae Britanniae Theologos,</hi> to those Decisions on behalf of the Contra-Remonstrant cause, which in the printed Acts of the <hi>Dort</hi> Synod, are attributed unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> But hitherto I have argued concerning Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> onely <hi>ex hypothesi,</hi> upon a supposal that he did really, and indeed, deny the members of the said Synod to have been initiated into this Honour by the solemnity of an oath, taken for the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down the Remonstrant Doctrine (howsoever.) But I am yet in suspence whether this supposition be to be admitted for truth, or no, or whether the said Bishop did ever either open his mouth, or imploy either his heart, or hand, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the members of the said Synod from subjecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the specified oath. The letter procured by Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to be printed with his name, and as dated from <hi>Higham,</hi> is scarce so much as a topical ground of belief to me, that therefore it was either of his penning, or inditing. I declared lately that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> hath himself utterly defaced, yea destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that principle in me (my opinion of his veracity) by which I should have gratified him with my belief at such turns as this. So that he hath no cause to be offended with me for my not believing him, but with himself onely. Him that will speak untruths one after another, above ground, who can believe when he speaketh underground? <hi>Dignus non est quicum in tenebris micem.</hi> I dare not play at even and odd with him in the dark. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> oft reproveth him for the frequent digressions of his pen out of the way of truth (I mean, of truth-speaking even in matter of fact) <hi>You are</hi> (saith he) <hi>a daring man, and dare say this.

For my part I cannot conjecture, much less determine, define, or describe, what Authority that is, or may be, <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then which either in respect of the universality, or unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of it, the Christian world at this day yieldeth none,</hi> unless it be the Divine Authority of the Scripture, or of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

For doth not he that shall swear thus to do, according to the plain and direct sense of the words of the oath, swear to do that, which onely such a person is capable of promising up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any terms of certainty to perform, who is acted, yea, and knows that he is acted, yea and that he shall be acted when himself pleaseth, with a spirit of infallibility? For who can say, or promise (and withal give sufficient security for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance) that he <hi>will judge and determine of points controverted</hi> (especially of the deepest and most profound points in <hi>controversie) onely out of, and according to the written word of God,</hi> but onely they, who know themselves to be infallibly inspired, yea and that they shall be infallibly inspired, with the true sense and mind of God in his word, yea and that they shall be prevailed with and assisted by the grace of God
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65873:183"/> to act according to the dictates and ducture of this spirit of infallibility, when they come to <hi>judge or determine</hi> of such points? Or is it a thing meet in it self, or any wayes agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Principles of Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> and his Confederates in the Synod, that men shall swear, or take an Oath, that God shall assist them with a spirit of infallibilitie, or shall not fail to assist or bless them with the discovery of the truth, when, and in what cases themselves please? Or was there not every whit as much as this plainly contained in that Oath, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is confessed that the <hi>Dort Synodians</hi> did swear, <hi>that they would judge and determine of the points controverted onely out of, and according to, the word of God?</hi> And whether they have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged or violated this oath in <hi>judging</hi> and <hi>determining</hi> the said <hi>points,</hi> as they have done, the day when every mans work shall be manifest, will determine. Yet</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In case, when they submitted to the taking of the Oath now under question, some such question as this had been put to them, whether they did not judg that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sense and judgment touching the points controverted, or to be controverted in the Synod, was <hi>according to the word</hi> of God, or no, and so whether their intent and meaning in their oath was not, <hi>to judge and determine the points in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie</hi> according unto these; what may we reasonably conceive their answer would have been? Doubtless they would not have denyed, but that they judged their present judgement touching the <hi>points</hi> in <hi>controversie,</hi> to be <hi>according to the word of God.</hi> Therefore when they swore or took Oath <hi>to judge and determine</hi> these <hi>points according to the word of God,</hi> did they not (in effect) swear, that they would <hi>judge and determine</hi> them according to their own present sense and judgment? now their sense and judgment touching the said <hi>points,</hi> at the time of their taking of the Oath, being opposite to the Doctrine of the Remonstrants, did they not (constructively) take Oath <hi>to vote down the Doctrine of the Remonstrants?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where is Mr. K. by this time with his <hi>Cornish hugg?</hi> and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> with his <hi>tumble over and over?</hi> Had he not cause, more then would serve the turn by the one half, to sing, <hi>Io Paean,</hi> over and over, for his famous victory? Hath not the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:65873:184"/> cause in abundance to rejoyce in her vindicator, who in stead of killing, hath onely awakned a sleeping Lion upon her; and undertaking to stop the mouth of an unhandsome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port concerning her (which was as good as stopt before) hath wide opened it, and occasioned such an inquiry into it, which gives it ten times more countenance and authority then it had before. Master <hi>Kendals antidote</hi> proves no better to his patient then poyson: yea much worse then that <hi>poyson</hi> (so by him unskilfully and untruly called) which he childishly complain'd was given her by another. May such Synods have such Physicians when they are sick of an evil report, and such vindicators, when they are justly accused. But</p>
               <p>Fourthly, (and lastly) that the Synod was resolved before hand to <hi>vote down,</hi> or give sentence against the Remonstrant cause (and doubtless this resolution was concurrent with the Oath which was now upon them) appears by the first of those reasons or motives which they delivered in writing unto <hi>Nicolaus Grevinchovius</hi> and <hi>Simon Goulartius,</hi> for their removal out of the Synod, after they had admitted them to sit there. The tenour of this reason was; <hi>because it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by their letters of credence that they were sent to defend the cause of the Remonstrants; whom they must renounce, if they meant to sit as judges in their place.</hi> And however, upon the invalidity and emptiness of this, with the other two reasons insisted upon by the Synod for the removal of the said two persons from amongst them, clearly demonstrated by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant party, the said persons were permitted to keep their places, yet would not this be, nor was, granted unto them but under certain conditions, which were not onely unjust in themselves, and contrary to the nature of a free Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, but such also which were not exacted, or required of any of the rest of their members. And what can be the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this text, but that Mr. Ks. clients (the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Synod) was extremely jealous before hand, lest they should meet with the least disturbance or opposition in their resolutions of voting down the Contra-remonstrant cause; that is, being interpreted, The truth. So that Master <hi>Kendal</hi> in his over-officious contending to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65873:184"/> maintain the innocency and honour of the Synod, was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of stumbling at the Proverb:
<q>
                     <hi>Plus foetent stercora mota.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <q>Dunghils the more you stir, the more they stink.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And by his importune strugling to take off from them a lighter jealousie, he calls to my remembrance a story repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Gilbertus Cognatus</hi> by Doctor <hi>Amez</hi> (on his preface to his smal treatise intituled, <hi>Puritanismus Anglicanus</hi>) of a man with an ulcer or sore in his face, who passing over a bridge where the passengers were to pay a certain piece of money for every malady [or ailement] of body found upon them, was required to pay the accustomed tribute for the ulcer in his face. But he refusing to pay it, the Officer or toll-gatherer, pulls off his hat, intending to keep it for a pawn; his hat being taken off, another malady appears in his bald head.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Apparet in calvitie alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum vitium alopeciae.</note> Now sir (saith the Officer to him) I must have a double tribute of you. Nay (saith the travellour) that you shall not, and begins to struggle with the officer; who being too strong for him, gave him a foil, by means whereof there was a rupture perceived under his coat [or garment] Now (saith the Officer again to him) I must have a treble tribute of you. And so the poor man, by refusing at first to pay one piece of money, or single tribute, was now compelled to pay three. I shall freely leave the application of the story to Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> himself. Nor shall I burthen him with the emblem of the young Bear, who intending to do his master, being asleep in the fields, a courtesie, by mauling a poor flie that troubled his rest, strook her paw, or talons, into his head, and slew him. The motto of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem was, <hi>Stultorum gratia ingrata.</hi> Fools courtesies are for the most part importune and thankless. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ill office which he hath done to his beloved <hi>Synod,</hi> by strengthening the hand of that jealousie against it, which before was but comparatively weak and inconsiderable, and though he hath done little more then may be summ'd up in a
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65873:185"/> cypher, to disable any thing that I have said, or suggested to the disparagement of it, yet how deeply hath the gentleman ingaged his fancy, to insult this simple and childish insulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over me? <hi>Your victorious breath, which makes a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable noise then that of Joshua's new fashioned trumpets, hath laid this Jericho so low, that no man may presume to hope to see one stone of it ever stand again upon an other. But how ever, let all the stones be thrown at your forehead, it is so signally impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable, that it disdains to admit the least shadow of impression. Lo here a Goliah for the nonce, who in stead of a weavers beam, contents himself with a shuttle, and looks the most glorious host of the God of Heaven down to the ground. All the kettles in Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manstreet will not suffice for drums at this triumph, nor any other chair, but a new sella curulis, after the cut of Porphyrie, one for him be carried in a meet solemnity, upon the shoulders of his learned admirers and adorers. What undeserved honour did he vouchsafe to put upon Cambridge, when he condescended so low as to challenge her heads, having given all the members of the Synod of Dort to the fowls of the air, and tbe beasts of the field? And yet this huge Conquest stood him in no more then a big look,</hi> Vidit, vicit. <hi>But what was this same thing which we call the Synod of Dort? tush, not half so venerable an assembly, as that, which used to be summoned at Swan Alley. What was</hi> Carletons <hi>rochet, to some of your Reverend green Aprons,</hi> &amp;c. Thus far, and somewhat further, that grave and venerable thing, called Mr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> in his Theological hypotyposis calculated with much care and study, for the setting▪ forth of his never-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently-self-admired faculty in jearing and insulting▪ where and when he hath more cause to be ashamed, and hide his face in the dust. And truly if a man had so little wit, as to set his wit against M. Ks. in the un-christian exercise of flurting, cracking, or insulting, there is (besides some other things of a worse import) a large seed-plot of hints and opportune ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in the passages now mentioned, to practise in these kinds upon himself, to the rendring of him very ridiculous, absurd, and childish. But</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> First, He jears and insults in the worst posture of all, as <hi>viz.</hi> Neither <hi>standing</hi> [as it seems the <hi>stones</hi> in his buildings
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65873:185"/> use to do] nor sitting [as the members of his Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> did in their Consistory] but lying all along, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms his Reader of my <hi>condescending so low as to challenge the heads of</hi> the University of <hi>Camhridge.</hi> If I had committed the error charged upon me in this indictment, and <hi>challenged the heads of Cambridge,</hi> it had been an innocent transgression, in comparison of the high misdemeanour of diabolizing, and false accusing of his Brethren, with the guilt whereof he pollutes himself here. I never challenged, either <hi>Head,</hi> or foot, of the University of <hi>Cambridge:</hi> Nor can I imagine what passage, or period, what clause or phrase, what word or syllable of mine, should any waies tempt or imbolden the conscience of the man, to draw my picture so like unto his own. But (if my memory faileth me not) I have conferr'd with him about the notoriety of this slander elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Towards the beginning of the late-recited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation, he compares his <hi>Dort</hi> Synod unto <hi>Jericho,</hi> which was <hi>execrable</hi> or <hi>accursed;</hi> yea &amp; the things in it, were accursed, yea a curse was denounced against him that should rise up to build it, after it was once destroyed (<hi>Jos.</hi> 6.) and yet in the progress thereof he blasphemously termeth the same Synod, <hi>the most glorious host of the God of Heaven.</hi> The leap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two characters is little short of that which the Barbarians made, when they first concluded <hi>Paul</hi> a murtherer, and presently after, that he was a God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When he reporteth my <hi>fore-head to</hi> be <hi>so signally impenetrable, that,</hi> &amp;c. doth he not suppose it to be made of the same brass with his own? But</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When he saith, <hi>Let all the stones</hi> of [his ruin'd] <hi>Jericho be thrown at my forehead,</hi> yet <hi>it is so signally impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it disdains to admit of the least shadow of impression;</hi> he makes me somewhat more in love with my <hi>fore-head,</hi> then I was before. For that which he saith, amounts to this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning it; that it knoweth not how to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the truth. By the <hi>stones</hi> of his <hi>Jericho,</hi> he can mean nothing (as far as I am skill'd in his rare allegory) but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions of his <hi>Dort</hi> Synod, with their grounds and arguments to maintain them. And truly if my <hi>forehead admits of no
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65873:186"/> shadow of impression,</hi> but despiseth the shame of having these <hi>thrown</hi> at it, it is a signe that the <hi>impenetrableness</hi> of it, is the workmanship of the same hand, which once made the the <hi>fore-head</hi> of that servant of God (the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi>) as an adamant, and harder then flint. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.9. But I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Mr. <hi>K.</hi> might suffer some <hi>Deceptio visus,</hi> in thinking those to be <hi>stones thrown at my fore-head,</hi> which were but stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and rotten wood: and these (we know) have no great gift of penetration. And if no <hi>impression</hi> be made by them where they hit, when they are thrown, it doth not argue any <hi>impenetrableness</hi> in that, at, or against which they are <hi>thrown,</hi> but an insufficiency in them, by reason of a natural lightness and yeildingness, to <hi>penetrate,</hi> or make an <hi>impression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Neither doth he speak workman-like, when he supposeth that the <hi>stones of Jericho</hi> ever <hi>stood one upon another. Stones</hi> in a building are not said to stand, but to rest, or lye one upon another: because they have no <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to the leggs of a man, or other living creature, as they have to the sides of either. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> should have done well to have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some Mason or Brick-layer to have been of his counsel in drawing up this piece of his idle and insulse insultation.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The reason which he gives why no man <hi>may presume to hope to see one stone of</hi> his <hi>Jericho ever to stand again upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is every whit as unarchitectonical, as the expression late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taxed. For it was not the falling down of the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> so flat as the Scripture mentioneth, nor yet the level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the buildings therein with the ground, that was the reason why no person could reasonably expect ever to see this city re-edified, or restored to its former strength or beauty. (For buildings are ofttimes pull'd down as low as the ground in order to their re-edification, and this with more splend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and strength then they had before) yea and several cities as much defac'd and ruin'd as <hi>Jericho</hi> was, have had their deadly wounds healed, and of ruinous heaps have been made defenced cities, and their latter glory hath been more then their former, as the Scripture speaks of the latter temple compared with the former. But the reason why there was no ground for any man to <hi>presume to hope</hi> ever to see <hi>Jericho</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:65873:186"/> re-edified, was, because <hi>Joshua,</hi> stirr'd up hereunto by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, had denounced a curse against every person that should go about to rebuild it. So that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> insults onely in non-sense, and non-truth hitherto. And if his mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Anti-typical <hi>Jericho</hi> lye under the curse of God, it is not his insulting <hi>breath</hi> over those who shall be anointed by God to do his execution upon it, that will either keep it standing, when the day appointed for the fall of it, shall come; nor yet recover it, being fallen.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, When he talks of a <hi>Goliah for the nonce, who in <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> stead of a weavers beam contents himself with a Shuttle,</hi> doth it not argue that himself is shuttle-headed, and that he is more then <hi>content,</hi> no less then highly apayed, with the <hi>shuttleness</hi> of his brain? For why, or how; or with allusion to what histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or fable, is he a <hi>Goliah,</hi> a <hi>Goliah for the nonce,</hi> who <hi>content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself with a shuttle?</hi> That <hi>Goliah</hi> rhe Scripture speaks of, whom <hi>David</hi> encountred and slew, hath nothing in his story applyed to him, belonging to a <hi>weaver,</hi> neither <hi>Shuttle,</hi> nor <hi>beam,</hi> nor woof, nor warp; onely the incredible bigness of the timber-staff of his spear, is expressed by the parallel of a <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers beam.</hi> And besides, to describe a <hi>Goliah</hi> with a <hi>shuttle</hi> in his hand, is altogether as absur'dly ridiculous, as it would be to paint <hi>Hercules</hi> with a feather in his hand in stead of a club. So that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> never appears more ridiculous himself, then when he intends to deride others. And if I should ask him, what saying of mine it is, one or more, or what inference it is from any of my sayings, which he compares to a <hi>shuttle;</hi> and withal should desire of him to know wherein the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or agreement between either of these and a weavers <hi>shuttle,</hi> consisteth, I believe he would either answer in silence, ot speak aloud his own shame and silliness.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, So whereas he discourseth the <hi>sufficiency of the ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in Colemanstreet,</hi> hath he imployed some Tinker to make the survey? Or doth he urge or insist upon the report and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of a tinker, to countenance or credit his Doctrine of Perseverance? Or is he himself a mettal-man, as well as a man of mettal? &amp; hath he made so diligent and narrow a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny into all the kitchins in <hi>Colemanstreet,</hi> that he is able to make such an exact estimate of all the kettles in them, and of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65873:187"/> their <hi>sufficiency</hi> for the end he speaks of, as that which he here exhibits unto the world? But (Reader) doest thou not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der al this while, how the <hi>kettles in Colemanstreet</hi> should come to give any distinct sound to prepare the judgements and consciences of men to receive Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> doctrine of perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? Or was not this the prize for which he pretended to run the long race of his book? although it be true, that the tinkling <hi>kettles in Coleman street,</hi> and the gingling arguments in Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> book, may stand in competition (without much reall disparagement to either side from the emulation or contest) which of the two are like to make the greatest Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to that cause of Perseverance, which is pleaded, though not so much in earnest, as in jest, in the same book.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, What he speaks jearingly in reference to me, &amp; that which he calls (in the same dialect) my <hi>victory,</hi> concerning a <hi>new sella curulis, after the cut of Porphyrie,</hi> and <hi>carrying in meet solemnity, upon the shoulders of learned admirers and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;</hi> did he not intend for a pattern or portraicture of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which he judgeth due unto himself, and accordingly expects (with <hi>Haman</hi>) will be done unto him; as fearing, lest, if he himself should not have endited the method, terms, and manner of his own elevation, &amp; how and after what manner in all points, he would be honoured in the world for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Conquest over the <hi>Giant Gog-magog upon Dover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffts,</hi> the fancies and judgments of other men in adorning and setting forth his triumphs, would have been injurious to his sacred merits, and undervalued the coelestial heights of his never-sufficiently-admired atchievements? So when he speaks ironically of my <hi>giving the members of the Synod of Dort to the fowls of the air, and beasts of the field,</hi> because he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth (though erroneously enough) that I attempted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest over them, but shamefully miscarried in that my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe (for what I attempted I have made good, nor is Master <hi>Kendal</hi> able either with truth or reason to overthrow any thing that I have said, either against, or concerning them) his politick meaning, estimated by his frequent straines of vain-glory elsewhere, seemes to be, that his attempt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering me, being performed with such rare magnanimity
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65873:187"/> and courage, and with success answerable, deserves as grand and magniloquent an elogium, as the <hi>giving of my flesh to the fowls of the air, and beasts of the field.</hi> And so again upon the same account, when deridingly he ascribes an <hi>huge conquest</hi> unto me, the secret of his meaning very possibly may be, to insinuate by what name or title he thinks it meet that his conquest over me should be called.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, When he demands thus; <hi>But what was this same thing which we call the Synod of Dort,</hi> answering himself with a <hi>Tush; not half so venerable an assembly, as that which used to be summoned at Swan-alley;</hi> his mind (it seemes) runs still upon the old Episcopal doings, and the tail of that Hierarchie, (the Apparitour, or summoner, I mean) is yet lodged in his head. But for his question, <hi>what was the thing called by him and others, the Synod of Dort;</hi> there was a Poet, who during the sitting of this Synod, gave answer to the import of it, in this Distich;
<q>
                     <l>Dordrecti Synodus, nodus; status integer, aeger:</l>
                     <l>Conventus, ventus: sessio, stramen: Amen.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The felicity of the <hi>Latine</hi> elegancy can hardly be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd in our <hi>English</hi> tongue: yet the sense of it may (in part) be thus expressed to the capacity of the Reader, whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding knows the tast of no tongue besides.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The <hi>Dordren</hi> Synod is a tangled knot:</l>
                  <l>Weak in her strongest state:</l>
                  <l>Her meeting, wind: her sitting, straw:</l>
                  <l>Amen: this be her fate.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> Question, <hi>what was that same thing which we call the Synod of Dort,</hi> is (I fear) too intricare and hard for himself, wisely, truly, and distinctly to answer. And himself (it seems) constructively confesseth as much, in describing it onely in the negative, and telling us what it was not, instead of declaring what it was. <hi>Tush</hi> (saith he) <hi>not half so venerable an assembly, as that,</hi> &amp;c. I know not by what <hi>decempeda,</hi> or by
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65873:188"/> what <hi>Jacob's</hi> staff Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is wont to measure the <hi>venerableness</hi> of an <hi>assembly,</hi> that he is so able to compute the one <hi>half</hi> of such a thing so exactly. But I shall not contend with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his measure here; but admit his comparatively nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive definition of his <hi>Synod,</hi> for truth; onely taking leave to interpret one of his terms, <hi>summoned,</hi> in a sense somewhat improper, yet tolerable enough. For there is no <hi>summoner,</hi> or apparitor, that <hi>useth</hi> to be imployed to gather together the <hi>assembly</hi> meeting at <hi>Swan-alley:</hi> but the several members hereof are <hi>summoned</hi> together onely by their own pious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spositions and desires to worship God, and hear his word preached unto them publickly, knowing the times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons appointed by common consent for these sacred exercises. The word, <hi>summoned,</hi> thus understood, I cannot but seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously approve his parabolical description of the <hi>Synod, [not half so venerable an assembly, as that which used to be summoned at Swan-alley]</hi> though his <hi>genius</hi> intended nothing but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and matter of derision in the indicting and framing of it. But the saying of the Poet is fallen upon Master <hi>Kendal</hi> at unawares:
<q>
                     <l>—<hi>ridentem dicere verum</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Quid vetat?</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>

               <p>For a Church of Christ assembling together to worship God in Spirit and in truth, and to hear his word soundly and sincerely preached unto them, is a far more <hi>venerable assembly,</hi> then a company of men from several nations, unknown (for the most part) one unto another, assuming, or accepting, a power to condemn the innocent, and to vote down several the great truths of God, in the name of errors and heterodox o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions▪ But</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, When Mr. <hi>K.</hi> demands, <hi>what was Carletons roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>het to some of your more reverend green Aprons?</hi> the Muse <hi>Mnemosyne</hi> (I doubt) was not of his counsell. For I never
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65873:188"/> heard that neither <hi>Carleton,</hi> or his <hi>rochet,</hi> had any thing to do at the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> dreams very often of things that are not. But for some of the <hi>green aprons</hi> he speaks of, I have sufficient ground to believe that they would be too hard for his White Surplice in a Duel about the death of Christ, &amp; the possibility of the Saints non-persevering; and would humble him as effectually, as his learned Opponent did at the Act in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who (as the story goeth) left him scarce so much, as <hi>mum,</hi> to answer.</p>
               <p>But (I half fear) I have wearied the Reader with detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him thus long in the contemplation of so impertinent an object, as Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> childish and unsavoury insultations; these being demonstrations onely of the weakness of the man, not at all of the strength or truth of his cause. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are (it seemes) the darlings of his pen; and for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, &amp; content of words, no inconsiderable part of his Book. If any man thinks it worth his time to see him acting more of these insulting pranks, besides what we have taken know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, let him but looke into these pages, and he shall find him at his beloved exercise.

Why men so much desire to interess God in their cause. His jear of correcting the Evangelist for Barbarisme.

               <p>In one place, at once he blasphemeth God, and be-jeareth me, telling me; <hi>it was pity you had not been of Gods Counsel when he passed his Decrees concerning the salvation of men: you had given him doubtless most wholesome advice</hi> for <hi>his own glory, and mans good.</hi>

But it is the solemn infirmity of these men, (as elsewhere notice is given) to obtrude their own groundless and sensless notions in the Name of the Decrees of God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the judgments and consciences of men: and to arraign all those at the tribunal of their Confidence, who shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to make that streight which is crooked in these noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if they were guilty of no less presumption then of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them a regulation of the Divine Decrees.

And being bred and brought up in his younger days amongst the Muses, and many examples and patterns of a compt and courteous behaviour, and this in a learned University, yet in his riper years so far degenerating into an absur'd, petulant, and scurrilous genius and habit of foul language, as the book from page to page bewraieth him to have done, he putteth to rebuke (though with his own shame) a far better saying, then his full mouthed, or rather foul-mouthed <hi>Devon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb; I mean this:

               <p>Part. 2. p. 25. Having first profess'd that he <hi>wonders I should <label type="milestone">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65873:191"/> I confess the city of <hi>London</hi> hath long born the blame (with men of judgment and understanding) for over-valuing <hi>wood-cocks:</hi> yet I know not whether they deserve the imputation of this weakness in Mr. Ks. case, because I have met with a flying report (which I little heed, or examine, though there may be somewhat in it) that he begins to look back towards his former quarters. But I marvel a little why he craves <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the lightness of this simile in so important a matter,</hi> it being 1. altogether as weighty as his answer, (though no wayes pertinent to it) and yet he <hi>craves</hi> no <hi>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
               <p>These verses put into the one scale, and his <hi>wood-cock</hi> simile in the other, which may we reasonably think would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate? Or being both put together into the same scale, would not the <hi>piece of chaff</hi> he speaks of elsewhere, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh them both? And yet he <hi>craves</hi> no <hi>pardon</hi> for the <hi>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of these verses. But it is that solemn infirmity of the man, to confute sense with non-sense, light with darkness, truth with errour, that which is weighty, with that which is light: that which is serious, with that which is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous &amp; toyous, that which is sound with that which is rotten, that which is savoury, with that which is noysome, and that which is rational, with that which is absurd; as it were through a mistake of the Aphorisme in physick, <hi>Contraria contrariis curantur:</hi> contraries are to be cured by contraries. Nor doth he <hi>crave pardon</hi> for twenty things, &amp; ten in his short discourse against Mr. <hi>Horn,</hi> extreamly light &amp; unsavoury.

But we must take it as he gives it. <hi>Considering</hi> (saith he) <hi>the application of it, that which is payed onely for the ransome of another, is not enough to ransome you, but considering the value of it, it may be; so as a man may give so much for one quart of wine, as might have bought two: and for one woodcock in London, which would have bought half a dozen in Bodmin.</hi>

               <p>First, Doth any man <hi>give as much for one quart of wine,</hi> as for which <hi>he might have bought two,</hi> but onely such a man of whom the Proverb saith, <hi>A fool and his money is soon parted?</hi> And do you (Mr. <hi>K.</hi>) resemble God to such a man, and that in the very act of his folly?

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65873:193"/> but onely that, which is payed only for the redemption of another, without any other payed for his, so that upon this, he may be inlarged, or redeemed, if he will; not whether that ransome payed onely for another, be of a sufficient value to have ransomed him. That onely is properly said to be <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough</hi> for any end or purpose, by which the end may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without the use of any other, or further means at least in the same kind. To tell me that the <hi>ransome payed onely for another,</hi> is in respect of the <hi>value</hi> of it, <hi>enough to ransome me,</hi> is as if I should answer a poor man asking relief of me in his extremity; Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> your neighbour is a rich man, and his estate is <hi>enough</hi> to relieve you. Would such an answer as this be pertinent to the poor mans demand? Besides, Master <hi>Kendal</hi> could not but know, unless his <hi>Ingeniolum</hi> had forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him, that my question was not about the <hi>value</hi> of the ransome payed by <hi>Christ,</hi> as whether this ransome was <hi>enough</hi> for me in respect <hi>of the value</hi> of it. For they who judge it to have been payed for all men, cannot question the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency or enoughness of it for themselves in respect of the value of it. So that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> declines the manifest drift and scope of the question in his answer.</p>

For of what <hi>application</hi> doth he speak? or by whom is the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> he means to be made? <hi>Considering the application</hi> (saith he) <hi>that which is paid onely for the ransome of another, is not enough to ransome you.</hi> Why, or how, doth the <hi>application</hi> of what <hi>Christ</hi> hath payed <hi>onely for the ransome of some</hi> (we shall suppose this at present for argument sake) make it <hi>not enough to ransome all?</hi> Certainly it is rather the non-applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the <hi>application</hi> of it, that makes it not <hi>enough</hi> [actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally] to <hi>ransome</hi> all. For if all did apply it, there is no more question to be made but that it would be found <hi>enough</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to <hi>ransome</hi> all, and save all, then is to be made of the truth of the Gospel, which in twenry places affirms as much. If he speaks of <hi>application</hi> of it made, or to be made, by God
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65873:193"/> unto men, there is still the same consideration of it. For it is not his <hi>application</hi> of it, but his non-application of it, makes it not enough (in Master <hi>Kendals</hi> unhandsome dialect) actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to <hi>ransome</hi> all. Or if his meaning be, that the <hi>application</hi> of it made by God <hi>onely</hi> unto a few, is the reason why it is not <hi>enough</hi> to ransome or save all, neither will this yet do. For as the <hi>application</hi> which God makes of it onely unto those few, who are actually ransomed and saved by it, is not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the sufficiencie or <hi>enoughness</hi> of it; so to ransome or save them (for the property of Christs sufferings, or merits, is not altered, nor doth any sufficiency or <hi>enoughness</hi> accrue unto it, by any application of it whatsoever) so neither is the non-application of it unto others any reason to prove the non-enoughness of it (in any tolerable construction or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of speech) to ransome or save them. But it may be, by <hi>application,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> may mean, designation, or intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (though his word sounds somewhat wide from either of these) &amp; his sense in the clause in hand, be this: that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why that which Christ hath payed onely for the ransome of a few, is not enough actually to <hi>ransome</hi> all, though it be enough in value for this purpose, is, because God designed or intended it for the <hi>ransome</hi> onely of a few. Yet is there no truth in such a sense or saying as this neither. For suppose (for argument sake) that God hath designed or intended the ransom made by Christ onely to, or for, a few, yet this cannot be a reason why it should not be enough actually and <hi>de facto</hi> to <hi>ransome</hi> all. Because (as was lately said) in case all should believe, all should be saved by this ransome: but saved by it they could not be by, or upon their believing, unless it were enough to save them without their believing. For certain it is no mans believing adds any augmentation of sufficiency or worth unto the ransome payed by Christ. So that here Mr. <hi>K.</hi> puts us off with a little non-sense, and a jear, in stead of an answer. Yet</p>
               <p>Fourthly, (and lastly) let him entitle his answer to what sense he pleaseth, so it be such as his words will bear, neither of his two <hi>similies</hi> will handsomely correspond with it. For what though as much may be <hi>given for a pint of wine, as would
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65873:194"/> buy a quart,</hi> how doth this portraicture, or resemble, such a sense or notion as this; <hi>Considering</hi> the application of it, <hi>that which is payd onely for the ransome of another, cannot be enough to ransome me: but considering the value of it, it may be?</hi> what is there in his <hi>simile</hi> to answer, or illustrate, the insufficiency or non-<hi>enoughness</hi> of the <hi>ransome, payed only for another,</hi> to ransom me in respect of the <hi>application</hi> of it? Though the <hi>pint of wine,</hi> bought with as much as might have purchased <hi>a quart,</hi> be <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi> onely to Master <hi>Kendal,</hi> and drank by him, &amp;c. this <hi>application</hi> of it unto him, is no reason to prove that therefore the money given for it, was not <hi>enough</hi> ro have purchased ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pint for me also.</p>
               <p>His other <hi>simile</hi> of the different price of <hi>woodcocks</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and in <hi>Bodmin,</hi> is (I had almost said, being infected with so much converse with his dialect) more <hi>woodcock</hi>-like then the former. For how come either <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>Bodmin,</hi> upon the stage, on which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is now, histrio-like, acting? or what part do they bear in the tragi-comedie of his answer? Is the <hi>application</hi> of one <hi>woodcock</hi> dear bought, to the city of <hi>London,</hi> a reason why the money given for it was not enough to have furnished him with <hi>half a dozen</hi> at <hi>Bodmin?</hi> But how either the dearness of <hi>woodcocks</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> or cheapness of them at <hi>Bodmin,</hi> should give us any light to comprehend the darkness of his Answer, truly I do not yet see.

For in that passage, which at present exerciseth both his learning, and patience at once, I do not <hi>compare</hi> the Majesty of Heaven with any Prince on Earth, either <hi>Great,</hi> or little, much less doe I <hi>compare</hi> this <hi>Majesty</hi> with any <hi>Prince on Earth,</hi> in point of <hi>Greatness,</hi> or in respect of his <hi>Greatness.</hi> I
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65873:194"/> only here endeavour to represent the Holy Ghost as speaking reason [<hi>i. e.</hi> the dialect of men, or w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> men may understand] in ascribing <hi>Philanthropie</hi> unto God, by proposing and arguing a case (not a matter of fact, and himself a little before had so acknowledged, and termed it) in which, as in a glass, the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality of some mens interpretations of the Scriptures ascribing <hi>Philanthropie</hi> unto God, may be seen. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth God unto any thing, must affirm something of him, or attribute something to him; and in particular, some such thing, the like whereof is found, or at least pretended to be found, in the thing unto which he is compared; Now in the passage which at this turn so turmoiles Mr. <hi>Ks. Genius,</hi> I doe not affirm any thing as being in God, nor as done by God: nor in particular do I affirm any thing of him in either kind, which holds any correspondencie, with any thing either found in, or done by, an <hi>Earthly Prince.</hi> How then can I be charged, but by a very inconsiderate mistake, with <hi>comparing</hi> God unto such a Person? For the purport of the said passage, is onely to remove from God the doing of such a thing, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>Philanthropie</hi> which the Scripture ascribeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, the like whereof were it done by an Earthly Prince would argue a principle in him of a contrary nature and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, I were the happiest man in the world, if that were the <hi>highest indignity I were capable of doing to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of Heaven, to compare him to the greatest Prince on Earth.</hi> For then were I not capable of sinning at all. For the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> himself compares him not onely to an earthly King or Prince, but to far meaner men. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.27.11.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.24, 27. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.1, 8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.33. Yet whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in the Scriptures the Holy Ghost representeth him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion, or styleth him by the Name of a <hi>King,</hi> (as he doth in twenty places and ten) he likeneth or compareth him to an <hi>Earthly Prince,</hi> or King. For certain it is that God is not properly or formally a King. For when, or by whom, or by what law, was he made a King? when, or by whom was he crowned? Therefore wheresoever he is styled, or called a King, he is thus styled, because of some resemblance, or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65873:195"/> between him, &amp; earthly Kings, in point of soveraignty, dominion, power, magnificence▪ &amp;c. and consequently is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> unto these <hi>Kings:</hi> for unto what other Kings, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he should in the said appellations be likened or <hi>compared,</hi> but these, is not easie to be imagined. Or may he not be without any <hi>indignity</hi> at all done unto him, be aswell <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to an Earthly Prince,</hi> as to a <hi>man of war?</hi> Or doth the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost put any <hi>indignity</hi> upon him, in his <hi>comparing</hi> him to <hi>a man of war? The Lord is a man of war,</hi> Exod. 15.3. See likewise <hi>Esa.</hi> 42.13. Nay when <hi>Job</hi> compareth him to a <hi>Lion,</hi> yea to a fierce Lion, [<hi>ut ferox leo venaris me,</hi> Job 10.16.] did he do him any <hi>indignity?</hi> Or was King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> guilty of this crime for the like comparison of him? <hi>Esa.</hi> 38.13. Or was the afflicted state, or Church, <hi>of the Jews</hi> in the Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Jeremie</hi> so grievous an offender, in <hi>comparing the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of Heaven,</hi> not to a Lion onely, but to a much more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble creature, a <hi>Bear,</hi> and both in the same verse? <hi>He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.</hi> Lam. 3.10. Yea did God himself offer <hi>any indignity</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in <hi>comparing</hi> himself to a Lion, yea or to a leopard? Or doth he not expresly compare himself unto both, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Therefore I will be unto them as a Lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them.</hi> Nay God in comparing himself descends much lower then either Lions, or Leopards, or Bears: even to that silly creature, the <hi>Moth:</hi> yea much lower then thus, even to the very corruption or putrefaction of a creature. For are not his words these by his Prophet <hi>Hosea? Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness.</hi> Hos. 5.12. So that it is a most illiterate conceit, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy him that hath sat in a Deans chair, to think it any <hi>indignity</hi> at all done unto God (how much more, the <hi>highest indignity</hi> that a man is <hi>capable of doing</hi> him?) to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi> him <hi>to an Earthly Prince,</hi> especially to the <hi>greatest</hi> of such Princes. Yea the truth is, little can be spoken, little understood or known concerning God, but by those chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters and resemblances of himself which he hath stampt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his creatures, and hath taught men how to estimate and conceive of him &amp; his infinite perfections by these, only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Suppose Mr. K. had several children, and a meer stranger both to him and them, should take liking unto one of them, and shew much love to it, but should neglect, or rather hate, all the rest; and suppose we withal, that <hi>Mr.</hi> K. himself should do likewise [I mean bear great love and affection only unto one of them, and rather hate, then respect, the other] were this stranger any whit more a lover of <hi>Mr.</hi> Ks. children, then <hi>M.</hi> K. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, because he hath not the <hi>like tye</hi> upon him to love them which <hi>Mr.</hi> K. hath? Where there are ten children in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, whoever he be, whether under tye to love them, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, that shall mortally hate eight or nine of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, although he should never so affectionately love the one or two remaining, yet is much rather to be reputed an hater of the children of the family we speak of, then a lover of them, or friend to them. Or suppose Mr. <hi>K.</hi> be much taken and extraordinarily pleased with 2 or 3 pieces of old gold, which his grand-mother, or some especial friend, bequeath'd unto him, so that no money nor moneys worth, could pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase them out of his hand, but should be a very ding-thrift and profusely prodigal of all other coyne that should come to his hand, were his impotent or inordinate addiction to his two or three pieces of gold, a reasonable ground to judg, or term him, covetous, or a great lover of money? and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his profuseness otherwise, a far more reasonable ground from which to reflect the imputation of prodigality upon him? Nor is it at any hand likely, that the Holy Ghost
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65873:197"/> would have commended God unto the world by that most gracious property of <gap reason="foreign">

Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he loveth a far greater proportion of Angels, then Master <hi>Kendal</hi> is pleased to imagine that he doth of men: and yet he is not known by the signal denomination of <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thirdly, The three further differences, which Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> (I believe) thinks he hath acted the part of a subtile dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in discovering between God and a King, for the rescue of his cause from under the arrest of the comparison menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,

               <p>Secondly, What if a King, as Master <hi>Kendal</hi> and his, <hi>may</hi> (it seems) <hi>suppose, hath bound himself by an Oath solemnly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at his Coronation, to provide for them to the uttermost of his power, and that to his own particular prejudice</hi> (an oath, which I somewhat question whether Mr. <hi>K.</hi> would willingly take in case he were to be crowned, and yet more, whether he would willingly keep it) and God hath not bound himself with any such oath as, <hi>viz.</hi> to provide to the uttermost of his power for his creatures, &amp;c. doth this any whit more render him a <hi>lover of men,</hi> because he loves two or three (for instance) of a thousand, but irreconcileably hates the nine hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and seven remaining, then it would denominate a King a lover of his subjects, in case he should love them by two's or threes, and desperately hate them by hundreds and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands? what communion hath the difference now specified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and a King, with any alteration of the case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them under present consideration?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is no whit more able to help Master <hi>Ks.</hi> lame cause over the style of the comparison that al this while stands in the way of it, that <hi>a King is bound to relieve</hi> [his Subjects in their extremities] <hi>in order to his own advantage,</hi> First, <hi>In point of honour,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, <hi>In point of profit,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65873:198"/> God hath no such tye upon him in reference to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For whether a King be more bound to love, or shew love to his Subjects, then God to his creatures, is no part of the question: Nor is the resolution of these questions any ways conducing towards the dis-parallelling the case put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and an Earthly King. For that which must dis-parallel in this kind, must be some reason assigned, if any such were assignable, whereby it may appear, that however a King cannot be reasonably termed a lover of his Subjects, in case he onely loves two or three favourites about his court, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hating all the rest; yet God may reasonably be termed <hi>a lover of men,</hi> although he loves onely a like proportion and (as it were) a first-fruits of his creatures, irreconcileably ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the great masse and body of them, and irreversibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing them from eternity to the vengeance of eternal fire. Evident it is by what hath been argued, and (indeed) in the nature and consideration of the thing it self, that a freedom from tyes and ingagements to <hi>love,</hi> doth not give a denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>loving,</hi> more then a being under such tyes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, where the love is but the same, or porportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the same, under both. He that shall love or shew love unto persons being under no ingagement to do either, may reasonably be termed more <hi>Gracious</hi> or to shew more grace, then he that shall love the like numbers, being obliged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; but there is no reason or ground why he should be judged, or said, to <hi>love</hi> more, or rather, then he. It is no more the property, or commendation of love, to love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, then with, ingagement: yea in some cases (at least, if not in all) that <hi>love</hi> is most commendable, which is born and expressed, where ingagements are both in greatest number and weight. It is more commendable in a man to love those of his own house, as his wife, children and servants, then those of like relation to another man, though his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements be more to love the former then the latter. But Mr. <hi>K.</hi> still hath the <hi>ill luck</hi> (as his own phrase is) to light upon answers that are impertinent; and that leave the bands, which they pretend to discharge, in full force, strength, and vertue.</p>

In these and such like passages, by <hi>all the nations of the Earth,</hi> to understand, Some of every nation, and by the <hi>blessedness</hi> promised, the actual collation of Faith, Repentance, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by <hi>Christ,</hi> is to expose the word of God, and this in the most evangelical streynes of it, to uncertainties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventures, as to the truth of it, and withal, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, or just cause, to carry the sense and meaning of it quite besides the ordinary and plain construction of the words. For first, these words, <hi>all the nations of the Earth,</hi> can in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular or tolerable construction of the words (nor did any good Author ever use them in such a sense) signifie some few, or some inconsiderable number in these nations (respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) but the generality (at least) or the far greater number of them. Secondly, It cannot be proved, that in every nation, there either have been, or ever will be, any at all (no, not the smallest number) actually converted to the Faith, or eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally saved. That in <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9. doth not prove it. All that can be inferred from thence, is, that the intire body of the Saints (there presented in vision unto <hi>John</hi> figuratively
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65873:199"/> in the four beasts, and twenty four elders) acknowledge themselves with all thankfulness and acclamations of joy to their Blessed Redeemer, that the Redemption purchased by his blood, was the happy meanes that had brought them, who had lived in nations and countreys far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote one from another, and who before had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, or relation unto one another, into that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py estate and communion, wherein they now enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another in God, with all felicity, joy, and glory otherwise. That particle or note of universality, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>omnis, all,</hi> or every, though most properly and very frequently, it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a strict universality, yet is oft used in a kind of indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite signification, and imports onely an indistinct plurality of particulars under or within an universality; when <hi>Johns</hi> disciples informed him, that <hi>all men came unto him,</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Joh. 3.26.</note> [<hi>i.</hi> to Christ, to be baptized of him] their meaning was not that <hi>all men</hi> without exception, or all men, in the strictness of the expression, <hi>came unto him:</hi> for themselves, who were men, did not go to him: but their meaning was, that very great numbers of men came to him. See <hi>John</hi> 11.48. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.42. <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.23. (to omit many like) So that the meaning of God in this promise unto <hi>Abraham, In thee,</hi> or, <hi>in thy seed, shall all the families, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth be blessed</hi> [or as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it, <hi>shall,</hi> or may <hi>bless themselves</hi>] is undoubtedly, and must needs be, this (or to this effect) that whereas all the nations of the Earth, with all and every their inhabitants (respectively) were out of an happy and blessed, brought into a miserable and cursed estate by the first <hi>Adam,</hi> the common Progenitor of them all; so shall they be restored unto a like, or better and more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py condition by one, who according to the flesh, shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from thee. Now the Blessedness which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth unto <hi>Abraham</hi> should accrue unto, or come upon, all the nations <hi>of the Earth,</hi> by means of his <hi>seed,</hi> consisteth partly in dissolving and removing that curse, or in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of that sin, or guilt, which lay heavy upon them by <hi>Adams</hi> transgression, partly in putting them into a gracious
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65873:200"/> capacity of obtaining remission of all their other sins, (<hi>viz.</hi> by Repentance and Faith) and consequently of salvation it self in the end. That this blessedness, in both particulars of it, is come upon the world by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> I have proved at large in my book of Redemption; and besides, it is the clear Doctrine of the Scriptures from place to place. But to convince <hi>Mr.</hi> K. (if he be convinceable by the truth in her greatest evidence) that God is not therefore in Scripture called a <hi>lover of men,</hi> because he loves an handful, a remnant of them onely, hating all the rest with a perfect hatred, with an hatred as unquenchable as the fire of hell, but that the Scripture speaks more graciously and honourably of him then thus, giving testimony of the largeness of his heart in goodness towards this generation, I shall at present enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his meditations onely with that brief passage, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.9. <hi>The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.</hi> Will <hi>M.</hi> K. here interpret, <hi>is good to all,</hi> that is, to some of all sorts of men; or, to <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles, <hi>i. e.</hi> to some of either division? I confess this would be a <hi>singular</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and the newest thing I suppose under the Sun. For (doubtless) the soul of no Expositor ever yet entred into the secret of such an interpretation. Or will he say, that God may be <hi>good to all men,</hi> whilest he hath irrevocably and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all possibility of the least regret, doomed from eternity the far greater part of them to the endless and easless tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell fire? Or can the health, peace, protection, plenty, prosperity, which he vouchsafeth unto these men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a decree concerning them, and with an intent to bring the decreed vengeance upon them more plausibly by their abuse of these things, give him the denomination of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Good</hi> unto them? Was it Queen <hi>Esthers</hi> goodness towards <hi>Haman</hi> to invite him to a banquet, when she onely sought an opportunity hereby to accuse him before the King, &amp; with so much the more advantage to promote his condemnation and ruine? Or in case any man having a desire to Trapan Master <hi>Kendal</hi> into some act of unworthiness to his disparagement, and to cause his savour to stink in the eyes of men, should
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65873:200"/> in order hereunto, invite him to a feast of pleasant wines, and for his company and solace should invite also women pleasant of face and behaviour, but right made for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; should Master <hi>Kendal</hi> have cause to commend this man for his <hi>goodness</hi> unto him, because of his entertainment upon such terms?</p>
               <p>And when in the latter clause of the verse, it is subjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>And his tender mercies are over all his works;</hi> whether we take the words in a comparative <hi>sense</hi> (with <hi>Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and some others) or with <hi>Piscator,</hi> and many of his mind, in an objective sense, both the one and other vote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Master <hi>Kendal</hi> for the gracious and merciful incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of God towards mankind, or the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of men. If the <hi>tender mercies</hi> of God exhibited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, commend him at an higher and more admired rate, then any, or all his other dispensations, as of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power, justice, &amp;c. then certainly they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in their exhibition to such a paucity or inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of men as Master <hi>Kendal</hi> finds (it seems) in his narrow heart to restrain them unto. Well is it for the world, that Gods wayes and thoughts [of goodness and mercy unto men] are not Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> ways and thoughts, but as much higher then these, as the Heavens are higher then the Earth. He that is just towards all men, but merciful onely unto a few, is more to be commended and reverenced for his justice then for his mercy. In like manner he that acteth wisely in all his wayes and doings, but mercifully one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in some few of them, is more considerable for his wisdom, then for his mercy.</p>
               <p>Again, if the meaning of the said clause be, <hi>his tender mercies are over [i. e.</hi> towards] <hi>all his works,</hi> and that there is no creature of his in any respect, or sense, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>mercy,</hi> from which he withholdeth it; this bids yet a more manifest and higher defiance to Master <hi>Kendals</hi> low conceit of Gods goodness and mercy, and fills the whole Earth with them, whilest he makes them commensurable onely to a small part or angle hereof. Or are not men, whoever they be, some of Gods works, yea such of his
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65873:201"/> works, (if we speak of those yet living) who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their natures in conjunction with their condition, are the most proper and capable objects of mercie? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Master <hi>Kendal</hi> is a malignant Interpreter of that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropie,</hi> which the Scripture so highly commends in God; and thinks that he deals very munificently by him, when he lifts up his mercy and goodness to the low sphere of his own imagination, when as the Holy Ghost plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmeth that they reach unto the Heavens. And not contenting himself with the solace of abounding in his own sense, he poureth out his discontent at the truth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon him like an armed man, in unhandsome, uncivil, and unsavoury deridements of those, who hold it forth unto him.</p>
               <p>I cannot give any other reasonable account unto my <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> self, or others, why Master <hi>Kendal</hi> should poure out himself in gibeings and jearings so impotently, all along (in a manner) both his books, not contaning himself, no not in the very midst of things of the highest, the most sacred, and dreadful concernment unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and all other men, but onely this, that he thinks that his jests, and conceits, and scurrilous entreatings of his adversarie, will serve as wine to his Readers, to cause them to forget the sorrow of losing their time in reading such impertinent, frothy, and unsatisfying answers, with such other so unprofitable and un-edifying stuff, as both his volumes are stufft and built with, to that bigness, wherewith they now cumber the world. Certainly never was any man that ever undertook the answering of any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course or book, less provoked by the style and carriage of things therein, to fall foul with reproachfull squibbs and jear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings upon his Adversary, then Mr. <hi>K.</hi> was by me in my book of Redemption, and this by his own confession, (as we heard formerly upon another occasion.) For in the very last page save one, of his former book, he gives me this testimony that [in my book of Redemption] <hi>I have not shewed much more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, then sobriety, in the whole carriage of the business.</hi> If (as I formerly argued) I have not shewed more, or not <hi>much more
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65873:201"/> subtilty then sobriety,</hi> in <hi>the whole carriage of my business,</hi> and yet (by his own confession and acknowledgment, however) have shewed so much <hi>subtilty</hi> herein, which amounts to a <hi>prodigy,</hi> certainly the <hi>sobriety</hi> which I have shewed in it, falleth not much short of a <hi>prodigy</hi> also. In the mean time is not Mr. <hi>K.</hi> the more inexcuseable, that being not onely un-provoked, but having an example of <hi>sobriety</hi> in writing, all along before him, is yet so intemperate and petulant with his pen, that there is scarce any page in either of his great books, but is blotted and stained with some unhandsome and Un-Christian jear or other, at him, whom he would needs make his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary without cause, and who neither meant him the least ill-will, nor any disquietment of the least of his beloved notions or conceits? Yea confident I am, that if any one page of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the said books be innocent of the offence mentioned, the guilt is multiplied to a double and treble proportion in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I have onely in a few of his own instances <hi>answered</hi> him in part <hi>according to his folly, lest he should be wise in his own conceit,</hi> &amp; please himself in his vein, &amp; vain humor of jeasting &amp; jear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if even those that are scarce fit to <hi>teach boyes in a bell-frey,</hi> might not set their threshold by his in that faculty, if they did but a little set their minds to it. The rest of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness in this kind I shall cover with silence; and make it my Request to his Reader on his behalf, that he will measure and judge of him by his intellectual weaknesses onely, and not by his moral also; considering that it is very tolerable, a person no better principled in his understanding, should be no worse or more dangerously corrupted in his moralities, or the inferior part of his soul, then onely to over-indulge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, partly in a superficial and light humour of entrapelizing, and partly, in a more sowre and course disposition of affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without cause the names and reputations of men with his pen.</p>

               <p>A Considerable part of Master <hi>Kendals</hi> book is taken up with such passages and sayings, wherein he would have the Reader believe that he crosseth lines with his Adversary, when as he parallel's onely. His policy and reach herein is to induce his Reader to believe, that his Adversary is so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormously foul and extravagant in his judgment, as to hold all things contrary to what is delivered and asserted by him in such a way. In his Latine address to his Mother, he boasts of his <hi>Dissertation, as rejoycing chiefly in her expatiation, that she might the more accurately delineate and describe the right, or just soveraingty, of God over men, and the injuries of men towards God.</hi> Whereby he would insinuate, that his Adversary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the said just soveraignty of God over men, and either extenuates or denies also the injuries of men done unto God. Whereas any considering man that shall diligently compare his book with the writings of his adversary, will clearly find, First, that that which he would obtrude and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten upon God under the notion of his just soveraignty and right of power over men, is no ways consistent with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteness of his goodness and mercy, but reprochful unto him, yea and is plainly enough disclaimed by himself in the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65873:203"/> Scriptures; whereas that Soveraignty in this kind, which his Adversary ascribes unto God, is both every ways of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with his nature and all his Attributes, and accordingly claimed and avouched by himself in his word. Secondly, that his <hi>Dissertation</hi> is so far from giving any tolerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the injuries measured out unto God by men, that (upon the matter) he wholly palliates and excuseth them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving them into the will of God himself, as their original, and principal necessitating cause, comforting even the first-born Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> with this consolation, that their reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by God from eternity considered, there was no possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for them to walk in the wayes of salvation. Whereas his Adversary clearly layeth all the injuries that are done by men, at their owne doors, proving that they are no wayes necessitated, neither by any positive, nor by any privative act of God, to perpetrate any such thing; but that whatsoever they do in this kind, they do it out of the voluntary maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perversness of their own wills.</p>
               <p>Soon after the beginning of his Request to his Reader, he <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> hath these words, directly commending himself in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of his book, but indirectly, and by way of insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taxing his Adversaries, as if they approved not of any such projection; <hi>The prerogative of God over all his creatures, to dispose of them as he pleaseth, is that which we are bound to maintain, let the world repine against it, as much as it either will, or can: we know that all the Earth should keep silence before him,</hi> &amp;c. Doth he not here (calumniating-wise) insinuate, that his Adversaries do not think themselves bound to maintain the Prerogative of God over his creatures, to dispose of them as he pleaseth? and that they are the men who find themselves aggrieved, and complain at what God acteth, in, or about the disposall of his creatures? Whereas the truth is, that He, and his party, though they pretend to maintain this <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of God,</hi> I mean, <hi>to dispose of his creatures as he pleaseth;</hi> yet that which indeed and in truth they maintain under the name of this <hi>Prerogative,</hi> is a necessity lying upon God to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose of his creatures as themselves (Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and his party)
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65873:203"/>
                  <hi>please.</hi> For these are the men who are <hi>pleased</hi> to conceit and hold, that God hath peremptorily determined from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not to what kind or manner of persons, but to what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons personally onely considered, he will give converting and saving grace, and this irresistibly; and that according to the gift of this grace, generally, universally, and against all possible interveniences whatsoever, he purposeth to give sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and on the other hand, that he hath in like manner determined, not to give converting or saving grace to such or such persons by name, and this without any consideration of, or respect had unto, any neglect, disobedience, or provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (in the least) in these persons; and accordingly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all possible care, diligence and conscience, which these persons can use in seeking the face and favour of God, that he hath irreversibly purposed to inflict the vengeance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fire upon them. Now a disposing of the creature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, and according to such terms as these, is a disposing of it, not as God <hi>pleaseth,</hi> but as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates <hi>please.</hi> Nor doth the Scripture any were attribute such an unreasonable, uncouth and unequal disposition of the creature, as this is, unto God. <hi>Are not</hi> (saith he here) <hi>my wayes equal, O house of Israel? are not your wayes unequal?</hi> Ezek. 18.29.</p>
               <p>A few lines after the former saying, he presenteth us with these words (as elsewhere upon another occasion we have transcribed them) <hi>And yet we say not that God excerciseth his <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> prerogative in any thing but this: that he gives, or denies Grace, as he pleaseth;</hi> Doth he not assert this as a notion, or opinion appropiate to himself, and men of his judgment, and as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, or denied by his Adversaries? But certainly he is not able to produce any one man from amongst all his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but who altogether as freely and roundly as himself, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serteth this prerogative unto God, <hi>to give and deny grace as he pleaseth.</hi> But it is frequent and familiar with these men to entitle God to all their own opinions: and consequently hereunto, to charge their Adversaries with fighting against God, his Grace, or his truth, when they onely discover the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65873:204"/> nakedness of, and put to rebuke the spurious and illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate conceptions of these men concerning God, and his counsels and ways.</p>
               <p>In one place he saith; <hi>but none of the world had any privilege of Jubilee, or any other Ceremonie, till they became Proselytes; and so have they not of Christs death, so as to be saved by it, till they believe,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Part. 3. p. 160.</note> His adversative particle, <hi>but,</hi> imports that he would have his Reader suppose that he speaks these things in opposition to his adversaries, as if they held, that persons of other nations might have had benefit by the <hi>Jubile,</hi> whether they were <hi>Proselytes,</hi> or no: &amp; so, that men might, or may, be saved by <hi>Christs</hi> death, whether they believe, or no.

He commends an <hi>humble submission of our thoughts to all that the Scripture delivers concerning God,</hi> as if this were an honor so appropriately belonging unto himself, that I have neither part nor fellowship with him in it: yea he insinuates against me, the crime of <hi>a bold enquiry into those arcana, which he</hi> [God] <hi>hath thought meet to conceale, as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us to excercise our Faith, rather then our wits.</hi> Why Master <hi>Kendal</hi> should taxe me with <hi>a bold enquiry into such arcana,</hi> or secrets, <hi>which God hath thought meet to conceal,</hi> I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or ground at all. For certainly whatsoever God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Scriptures, are none of these <hi>arcana,</hi> but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and comfort of them is intended by him <hi>for us and our children, Deut.</hi> 29.29. And as certain I am, that I make no <hi>enquiry</hi> at all (much less any <hi>bold enquiry,</hi> as I am more <hi>boldly,</hi> then truly charged) into any thing concerning God, but onely <hi>what the Scripture delivers concerning him;</hi> unless (happily) it be into Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> and his co-opinionists wild, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, and blasphemous notions and speculations concerning God, taken up and managed, not onely besides, but in mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest opposition to the Scriptures.

For certain I am, that God in his great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the world, in, and by the Scriptures, <hi>requires</hi> of men to understand, and consider, before they believe; to <hi>try all things,</hi> before they <hi>hold fast</hi> any thing, even <hi>that which is good.</hi> And the true reason why there is so much rotten and unsound Faith in the world, is the generall observance of Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> prescript of devotion, the <hi>excercising of</hi> mens <hi>Faith</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Scriptures, before, and more then, <hi>their witts.</hi> But he and his Consorts, by imposing it as a duty and matter of conscience, upon their clients, to <hi>excercise</hi> their <hi>Faith,</hi> more or <hi>rather, then their witts,</hi> sufficiently declare that they very understandingly savour the things of their credit, with the sweet additional conveniency of ease. For if the people be prevailed with to <hi>exercise their Faith</hi> towards the things delivered unto them by their Teachers in the Name of God, and as contained the Scriptures, without <hi>excercising their witts</hi> to discover whether such things be indeed conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Scriptures, or no, these Teachers without the wind of much labour or study in the Scriptures, may in good time make the <hi>fair havens</hi> of honour and respects with them.</p>

               <p>Part. 2. p. 152. He saith, <hi>it is enough that without this patience <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> of God, none, no not even the Elect, would come to repentance, albeit all be not brought to repentance by this patience of God.</hi> This he exhibits in way of answer to my argument, from 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. By which I prove, that the Apostle doth not here restrain the <hi>long-sufferance</hi> of God here spoken of, to the Elect (as Master <hi>Kendal</hi> calls elect) but mentioneth it, as shewed to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of mankind; and consequently that Gods <hi>non-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness that any should perish,</hi> is not in like manner to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the said elect, but to be extended to the generality of mankind; and so his willingness that <hi>all should come to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and be saved,</hi> to be understood of all men indefinitely considered, not determinately of the said Elect. My argument to prove this (as himself reporteth it) is this, <hi>viz. because in case there were any elect in this sense the patience of God towards them would be no argument, or sign, of his non-willing their perishing or of his willing they should come to repentance; because he sheweth the same, or greater patience, towards such persons, who are not elect in that sense</hi> (nor indeed in any other, except it be a sense new-found) and who never come to believe, or repent. To this Mr. K. saith somewhat, which he calls, <hi>answering;</hi> even that which you heard; <hi>It is enough that without this patience of God,</hi> &amp;c. Surely the man thinks that any thing is <hi>enough,</hi> if spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him, to salve all sores▪ to <hi>answer</hi> all arguments, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate all difficulties, to stop the mouthes of all adversaries, to make truths of all erroneous and fond assertions whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>For what face, or colour of an answer is there in the words mentioned, to the argument that lay before him? What though none, no not even Mr. <hi>Ks. elect</hi> themselves, <hi>would come to repentance</hi> without the patience of God, is this <hi>enough</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the argument, or to prove, that this patience is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument, or sign, of his non-willing their perishing &amp;c. especially against that demonstrative reason given by me to evince the contrary? But himself so gravely affirming, that <hi>without this patience of God none, no not even the elect, would come to repentance, albeit all be not brought to repentance by this patience,</hi> doth he not project the drawing of his Reader into this error
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65873:207"/> in his belief, <hi>viz.</hi> That his adversaries hold neither the one, nor the other, but that which is contrary to them both; as first, that those who come in time to repent (for these are his <hi>elect</hi>) might or would have repented, whether God had shewed them any <hi>patience</hi> or no. Secondly, that all without exception, are by the patience of God, brought to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Both which assertions have as little or less commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the judgement of his Adversaries, as Arrianisme or Socinianisme have with his. In his entrance upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond member of his answer, he tells me that <hi>He wonders what I mean,</hi> in words that are plain enough, and which a child might readily understand. Mr. <hi>Ks. wonders</hi> (it seems) are more wonderful then their objects. But if the Reader hath a mind to <hi>wonder</hi> (with Mr. <hi>K.</hi>) what a mans <hi>meaning</hi> should be in a period, or passage of words, let me for his satisfaction in this kind commend unto him a few lines subjoyned by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Kendal</hi> himself, soon after the words last recited from him. It is mentioned (saith He, but what his antecedent to his relative, <hi>It,</hi> is, is not <hi>mentioned</hi> by him, nor is it easie to conceive what it should be) <hi>as an argument to vindicate Gods seeming delay of his coming</hi> [certainly if God was not yet <hi>come,</hi> the <hi>delay</hi> or deferring of his <hi>coming,</hi> was not <hi>seeming,</hi> but real] <hi>should he come presently, many of his elect must perish</hi> [I thought, that according the rudiments of Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> Faith, the <hi>elect</hi> had been above all possibility of <hi>perishing;</hi> but his conceptions, it seems, are yea, and nay:] <hi>he being not willing, that is, pleased</hi> [a profound explication!] <hi>to defer it.</hi> [If God be not <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> that is, <hi>pleased, to defer his coming,</hi> who, or what, hinders him from <hi>coming?</hi> It seems Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to serve a turn, can make the <hi>will</hi> of God resistible or divertible, though otherwise it be neither with him] <hi>this patience in deferring his coming, is a motive unto them to repent, and a sign that he would have them repent, though it be no signe that he will alike have others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, to whom he shews like patience to repent.</hi> He had need be <hi>Antiochus</hi>-like, a man <hi>understanding dark sentences,</hi> that can un-riddle Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> meaning out of these words, at least to make it the <hi>meaning</hi>

                  </note> those, whom Mr. <hi>K.</hi> calleth, <hi>his Elect,</hi> a <hi>motive unto them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> at least more, then the like <hi>patience</hi> shewed unto others, is unto them? The like, or the same, patience of God towards all unregenerate men, whether <hi>Elect</hi> (in <hi>Mr.</hi> Ks. sense) or not elect, is a like motive to repent unto both sorts of them; although the one sort onely suffer themselves to be <hi>moved</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly by it. If it be otherwise, it lies upon Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it. The <hi>non-ens,</hi> or <hi>ens intentionale,</hi> of the pretended <hi>election,</hi> maketh no difference in this kind; if it should <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire de genere in genus,</hi> and become <hi>ens reale,</hi> neither could it upon this advantage make any such difference. If it can, or if any other thing can, it would be the salvage of some part of Mr. <hi>K.</hi> honour demonstratively to declare, or prove it. But he is better at affirming, then confirming; at asserting, then disserting. His Deans chair (it seems) spoyled a disputant, and made a Dictator.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The same, or like <hi>patience</hi> of God shewed alike to both the sorts of unregenerate men, how comes it to be a <hi>sign</hi> that he will have the one sort of them to repent, and yet be no <hi>sign</hi> of a like will concerning the other? especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when as he shews it even unto these others, <hi>to repent</hi> [that is, for I know not how to understand it otherwise, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they should repent by the means or opportunity of it.] What is it that makes it significative of such a <hi>will</hi> in God, either to, or towards, the former, or that hinders or destroyes the significativeness of it, whether to, or towards, the latter? (For unto whom, whether to his elect, whilest yet unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or whether unto men simply and indefinitely considered, his meaning is that the patience of God shewed to the said e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, should be a <hi>sign,</hi> he declares not, I understand not) As for such elect, being yet in a state of unregenerateness, they have nothing in them more then other unregenerate men, wherby to discern &amp; understand what the patience of God sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies; <hi>according to</hi> the common saying, <hi>praedestinatio nihil ponit in praedestinato,</hi> predestination infuseth nothing into the person predestinated. And how other men should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the patience of God signifies a willingness in him
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65873:208"/> that Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> elect should repent, and understand withal, that it signifies a non-willingness in him that Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> reprobates, or non-elect, should repent, I know not where, nor from whom to learn; especially considering that the elect we speak of, in the estate of impenitency and unbelief, are not, according to Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> own principles, discernable from the other. But of such raw, reasonless, and indigested stuff as this are his answers, generally throughout both his books, made. He yet here adds to the same tune;</p>

               <p>First, Concerning that over-worn threed-bare distinction, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> of <hi>voluntas signi,</hi> and <hi>beneplaciti,</hi> under the shadow whereof Mr. <hi>K.</hi> here solaceth himself against the scorching heat of the argument beating upon his head, it hath been dismantled elsewhere, save onely in such a sense, wherein it knoweth not M.

                     <hi>Redemption Redeemed.</hi> p. 104, 105, 106. &amp;c.</note> I here further add, or explain: If by <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas signi,</hi> he meaneth that will in God which is signified, declared, or revealed by him in his word, whether by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or prediction, how comes <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> or his will of good pleasure, to be contra-distinguished, or opposed to it? Is not the will of God, which he signifies or reveales, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially by precept, his will of <hi>good pleasure</hi> also? Or would he not be well pleased, yea as well pleased in case his will declared by precept, or his commandments, were obeyed by such persons who yet never do obey them, but remain finally disobedient, as he is, when they are obeyed by his servants? Or suppose we (for argument sake) that a sinner, who is none of <hi>Mr.</hi> Ks. elect, should repent, would there be no <hi>joy in Heaven,</hi> my, would there be less joy here, for his repentance, then there is for the repentance of any other person? Or in case <hi>Cain</hi> had refrained the murther of his brother, would not his obedience to the Law of God against murther, have been pleasing unto him, yea as well pleasing, as <hi>Abels</hi> forbearing to murther him was? Or is God an accepter of persons? Therefore in this sense both the members of Master
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65873:208"/>
                  <hi>Kendals</hi> distinction, are coincident, and the distinction it self upon this account, null. Or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, If by <hi>voluntas signi,</hi> Mr. <hi>K.</hi> means (as some of his notion explain it) the approving will of God made known by him, as, <hi>viz.</hi> by his holy, just, and righteous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by the tenour and import whereof he signifieth unto men, what ways and actions are pleasing to him and approved by him, and consequently what on the other hand are hated and abhorred by him; and by <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious or operative will of God, by which he reduceth into act, and effecteth, whatsoever he willeth according unto it; the terms of the distinction are very uncouth, and improper to carry such a sense or meaning to the minds or understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men. For the divine essence or nature of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as holy, just, and good, by reason or by means whereof he approveth such actions and wayes in men, as he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is most improperly termed his <hi>Will,</hi> in one kind or other: because by this, so considered, he <hi>willeth</hi> nothing at all. Nor yet by declaring, or revealing, his essence or nature under such a consideration, doth he <hi>will</hi> any thing, as is evident. But when he commandeth things just, and holy, and good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, he doth not onely reveal or make known the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or goodness of his nature, or essence (nor can this reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be judged his principal intent, if it be (any part of his intent otherwise then in a collateral and consequential way, in such his commandements given unto men) but he further declareth what his <hi>will and good pleasure</hi> (in such a sense as <hi>will and good pleasure</hi> are any wayes attributable unto him) is concerning men, and the things he desireth and requireth to be done by them. And that this is the thing primarily and principally intended by him in his precepts or command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given unto men, is evident from the express tenour of these commandments in general, and yet more evident from some additional expressions made upon occasion in some of them. In general, all the respective deportments, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whether actions, or forbearances, are directly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly by the Authority of the Law-giver, imposed upon men, without any intimation otherwise then (as was said)
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65873:209"/> in a consequential way (unless haply in some few of them) of his approbation of them. But in, and upon occasion of the delivering of some of them, there are words more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally importing the express mind or <hi>will</hi> of God to have them observed and obeyed by men. <hi>And now Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his wayes, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, That thou keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord, and all his ordinances,</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Deut. 10.12, 13.</note> &amp;c. He doth not say, <hi>what doth the Lord thy God</hi> approve of, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, delight in, or the like; but, <hi>what doth the Lord thy God require of thee,</hi> but to fear, &amp;c. Men are not wont onely to imply, and this darkly and obscurely, that which they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intend and aim at, and in the mean time plainly and significantly to express that which they secondarily onely, and less principally, mind or intend; although, according to the sense and explication of Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> distinction now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der examination, God doth not so much as intend, will, or desire, less principally, or at all, that far the greatest part of those, to whom he hath given his commandments should yeild obedience unto them. So <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good:</hi> but not onely so, for it followeth; <hi>and what the Lord requireth of thee, surely to do justly, and to love mercy,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore certainly Gods desire, will, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement in his precepts, or Laws, imposed upon men, is that they on whom they are imposed, should observe and do them. So that <hi>voluntas signi,</hi> in the most tolerable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensible sense of it (as that last proposed, and since opposed, is) is a very uncouth and horrid expression to signifie the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, as declaring what actions and wayes of men are approved by him. Neither can there any approbative, or approving <hi>will,</hi> be ascribed unto God, but by an high misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour committed against the propriety of speaking. For in this composition, an <hi>approbative will,</hi> there is little less then <hi>contradictio in adjuncto,</hi> unless by such a <hi>will</hi> shall be meant a <hi>will</hi> of declaring what is approved. And how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorably incongruous such a notion or sense as this is, unto the terms of an <hi>approving will,</hi> any ear that tasteth words, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65873:209"/> lightly but discern. For that principle, out of which a rational subject approveth, or disapproveth any thing, is not his <hi>will,</hi> but his judgment, conscience, or understanding. This is evident from hence; <hi>viz.</hi> that many men approve of that in their judgments, or consciences, which is contrary to their <hi>wills</hi> and desires. And that principle, by which every man approveth of what is truly approveable in himself, or in his own wayes, is not his <hi>will,</hi> but his judgment or consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>And for the sense assigned unto the other member of the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> distinction (now under censure) in the explication of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that by <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> Gods <hi>will of good pleasure,</hi> is meant his operative, or effecting <hi>will,</hi> neither doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort any whit better with the terms, then an arrow with a sheath made fit for a knife. For by this <hi>operative</hi> or <hi>effecting will,</hi> the explicators of the distinction mean, that kind of purpose, resolution, or intent in God, for the actual accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment or effecting whereof he intends to ingage and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert his omnipotency upon such terms, as to make sure that he will overcome all opposition, or resistence in his way. (For otherwise, God having no power at all, but that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite &amp; omnipotent, he must of necessity use and exert this, as well in his softest and gentlest actings, as in his strongest &amp; most wonderful of all.) Now first, this kind of will, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or resolution in God, is no where in Scripture termed <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> or will of good pleasure, at least in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of many the particular actings or movings of it. Nay secondly, in respect of some of these actings, it is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Scriptures as such a <hi>will,</hi> wherein he takes little or no <hi>pleasure</hi> at all, as <hi>viz.</hi> when it relates to the punishment of his creatures. <hi>For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God: wherefore turn your selves, and live ye,</hi> Ezek. 18.32. Again, by the same Prophet; <hi>Say unto them,</hi> As <hi>I live (saith the Lord God) I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live: Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil wayes; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</hi> Ezek. 33.11. Doubtless the will or resolution in God to punish and destroy wicked men, that shall be found
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65873:210"/> finally impenitent, is of that kind of <hi>will,</hi> which the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Distinction in hand, interpret to be meant by <hi>voluntas beneplaciti, viz.</hi> his operative or efficacious will (in the sense declared) yet is it so far from being indeed <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> his will of <hi>good pleasure,</hi> that he most solemnly and seriously and with an oath professeth (in the passages now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) that he hath no <hi>pleasure</hi> in the execution or effecting of it: and if not in this, then neither in the <hi>will</hi> it self (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered apart from its execution) There is the same conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his <hi>will</hi> or purpose to punish or afflict his servants themselves, when they incur his displeasure by sinning. There is little question but that his <hi>will</hi> in this kind, is of that kind of <hi>will,</hi> which the Distinctioners now impleaded, mean by their <hi>voluntas beneplaciti</hi> (at least if they mean as they speak) that is, a branch of his operative or efficacious <hi>will;</hi> yet is it no where in Scripture, either formally, or materially, either in terms, or sense, called his <hi>will of good pleasure. How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, &amp;c.</hi> Hos. 11.8, 9. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: <hi>For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</hi> Lam. 3.33. Adde hereunto: <hi>For they verily</hi> (the Parents of our flesh) <hi>for a few dayes chastened us after their own pleasure: but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</hi> Heb. 12.10. Do these expressions either from, or concerning God, sound a <hi>voluntas beneplaciti</hi> in him to correct his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? He that observes the use and acceptation of the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which more properly, then any other word that I know in Scriptures, when spoken of God, signifies his <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> his <hi>good pleasure,</hi> or <hi>will of good pleasure,</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly find the object or matter of it, to be some act of grace, goodness, mercy, bounty, or the like; never any thing penal or afflictive. See <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.26. Compared with <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.21. (Onely the dialect, or form of speech in these texts must be well observed, and interpreted as others of like character and phrase, <hi>viz.</hi> where there is an ellipsis of the word, <hi>quamvis,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though) as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.37. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Isa.</hi> 12.1. (according to the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65873:210"/>
                  <hi>Hebrew) Isa.</hi> 41.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.20. (with others) so also <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.11, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This <hi>will of good pleasure</hi> in God, as explained by <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> the Explainers, is very untowardly contra-distinguished to his <hi>voluntas signi,</hi> as understood and notioned likewise by them. For there is small reason to oppose that <hi>will</hi> in God, which in the Distinction they call <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> to that <hi>will</hi> in him, which in the other member of this distinction, they term <hi>voluntas signi.</hi> For the opposition sounds, as if his <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> were neither revealed in any of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of it, which is manifestly untrue, God indeed having <hi>revealed</hi> the whole compass or extent of his operative or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious <hi>will,</hi> as far as it is any wayes necessary or pertinent for men to know it; nor yet <hi>approved</hi> of by his will of <hi>approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which is somewhat more then petty blasphemy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That application of the Distinction, which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> here, and others of his perswasion, are wont to make in the like exigent, is neither Logical, nor Theological. Not logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: For thus Mr. <hi>K.</hi> (as we heard) with his partisans, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth it; <hi>God will have all, by that which they call</hi> voluntate signi, <hi>he will have his Elect to repent</hi> voluntate beneplaciti <hi>also.</hi> In which saying he takes that for granted, which he knowes that his Adversary stifly denies, and which himself hath not at all proved (and which indeed, interpretatively contains the <hi>summa totalis</hi> of the whole controversie) <hi>viz.</hi> that there are, or that God hath, such elect, in whom he works conversion, faith, Repentance, and all things accompanying salvation, by such a <hi>will,</hi> which alwayes sooner or later, actually raiseth and effecteth these things in them against al possible resistance whatsoever. Now in arguing to suppose that, not onely which a man knowes to be denied by him against whom he disputeth, but even that also, which by a near-hand conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, involves the grant, either of the whole, or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal thing in question, is extremely illogical. Again, the said application of the distinction (so understood as hath been reported) is no whit more <hi>Theological.</hi> For it ascribeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or supposeth in, God such a <hi>will,</hi> which the Scriptures know not, and which otherwise is il-consistent with his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65873:211"/> and repugnant to that great design, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and which he carrieth on in the world daily, in, and by the Gospel. This I have proved at large, and (I believe) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any reasonable answer or contradiction. The <hi>will</hi> I mean, is such a <hi>will,</hi> which the Assertors of it suppose to be operative of conversion, Faith, and Repentance in men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on terms of necessitation, or so, that it is not possible for those, in or upon whom it operateth, not to concur or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with it to the actuall production of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in them, and in the end, to the attainment of salvation. Now that there is no <hi>will</hi> in God, that worketh at any such rate, or upon any such terms in men, as these, and that if there were, it must needes render men uncapable of that great recompence of reward, Salvation, I have more then once argued, proved, and concluded elsewhere. I here su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persede the further debate of it. Besides, when Master <hi>K.</hi> saith, <hi>God will have all to repent</hi> voluntate signi, <hi>but his elect</hi> [onely] <hi>voluntate beneplaciti,</hi> doth he (in the former clause) mean, that God approves of the repentance of all men, (which must be his meaning unless he breaks company with the wisest on his side) or that he invites and calls all men to repentance; neither the one assertion, nor the other, holds any regular intelligence with his principles in the controversie undertaken by him. For 1. if God approves of the Repentance of all men, and yet doth not effect it as he doth the repentance of some, doth not this represent him as one doing good by <hi>halves,</hi> and omitting or neglecting more good, and this acknowledged and <hi>approved</hi> as such, by himself, then he doth? But by that which soon after followeth, it seems good Theologie with Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to conceive and say, that God doth good by halves. For are not his words these, (with an ironicall complement to boot?) Sir! <hi>Gods patience towards reprobates, is but patience by halves!</hi> The Scripture every where ascribes <hi>perfection</hi> to the wayes and works of God: but Master <hi>Kendal</hi> (it seems) hath disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a large vein of them w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> are <hi>imperfect,</hi> &amp; done <hi>by halves.</hi> Secondly, if in the former member of the distinction, his meaning be, that God invites or calls all men to repentance,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65873:211"/> and yet (in the latter) denies that he is willing to work or effect it in some, yea the greater part of men, and that knowingly he leaves these under an absolute and utter impossibility of obeying his call, or coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his invitation, in this kind; doth he not by such a party-coloured character as this, render the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation, a most bitter and bloudy insulter over the extreme misery and weakness of his poor creatures, occasioning, yea provoking and urging them in the mean time, to look upon him as most seriously, most affectionately, most compassionately desiring, seeking, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, their salvation? But this Theological soloecisme we have had (I remember) under large consideration else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Therefore concerning the Distinction of <hi>voluntas signi</hi> and <hi>voluntas Beneplaciti,</hi> with the common application of it, it deserves the like brand of dishonour which <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Piscator</hi> set upon another of its companions, (with the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all application thereof) <hi>viz.</hi> that, which tells us of <hi>Christs</hi> dying for all men <hi>sufficienter,</hi> but not <hi>efficaciter. That expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> (saith the former of these) <hi>Christ died for the sins of all men sufficiently, but not efficaciously, though in a rectified sense it be true, yet is it extremely harsh, and no less ambiguous, then barbarous.

               <p>So when persons of an unhappy agreement in the defence of errour, and opposition to the truth, fall at variance about the Distinctions imployed in that evill warfare, there is the more hope that truth will so much the sooner recover her native lustre, and be restored to her legitimate interest in the hearts and judgments of up-right and well meaning men.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> Fourthly, whereas to the subterfugie and unhallowed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of the Distinction now displayed in the proper colours of it, he immediately subjoyns (by way of explication of it, as it should seem, in both its members, respectively) <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all, enables his Elect, to repent;</hi> in the former clause he speaks as much, or more, the sense of his Adversaries, as his own; yet to what purpose, unless to insinuate to some super-simple Reader, as if they denyed even that also (<hi>viz.</hi> that God <hi>requires all to repent</hi>) In the latter clause, he under-speaks his own sense (if he understands, or remembers it) neither in this doth he say any thing, but what his Adversaries say al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. Yea he speaks short both of his own sense (at least if he hath not very suddenly changed his old sense for a new) and of the sense of his Adversaries likewise. For his own sense, this (questionless) is not that God onely <hi>enables them</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> (for this he might do, though they should for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main impenitent, no mans ability for action, enforcing or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitating him to act) but that he necessitates them to <hi>repent.</hi> Otherwise Mr. <hi>Ks. Elect</hi> may possibly never <hi>repent,</hi> and so fall short of salvation in the end: which (I know) is the great abomination of his soul. And as concerning his Adversaries, their sense riseth higher then to conceive that God onely <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables</hi> men to repent, at least when they do repent: They hold and teach, that God over and besides those means, and that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65873:212"/> ability of repentance, which he vouchsafeth unto all men (and so to <hi>Mr.</hi> Ks. elect) doth actually concur and joyn with them in the improving or employing of these means, and in the exertion or acting of this ability; and this so, and upon such terms, that the act it self of repentance performed by them, may, though not formally, yet by way of efficiency, be by an higher and far more worthy attribution ascribed unto him, then unto them. For the truth is, that for men to repent (and so to believe) considering on the one hand what dreadfully-important reasons and motives they have to do it, and on the other hand how mightily provoked, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously assisted they are, by God, unto the work, is in respect of the nature of it, and of that which proceeds from them, in and about it, no such great exploit, or matter either of much commendation, or admiration; the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> For men not to repent, the circumstances now mentioned being duly considered, being most irrational, brutish, and senseless, and altogether unworthy the common principles of reason and understanding in men. But now for God to call, yea to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, sinfull, weak, and ill-deserving men (creatures that had so unthankfully, rebelliously, provokingly entreated him) unto Repentance, by such great and precious promises, as he hath done; and not onely this, but further to quicken, strengthen, and assist them by the gracious concurrence of his own spirit, to, and in the work, is a matter of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and most worthy the magnificence of that God who doth it. In which respect that which proceedeth from men, or that which they do, in, or about the work of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is, in it self, little considerable, and (as we use to say) scarce worth the speaking of; whereas that which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from God in reference to it, is transcendently excellent, and wonderfully glorious. Hence it clearly follows, that though men who repent, be not necessitated by God to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> or so acted by him that they can neither will nor chuse but repent, but onely be so incouraged and assisted by him in order hereunto, as hath been mentioned [<hi>i.</hi> so as to be left by him at liberty, or under a possibility of non-repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, notwithstanding] yet all that which is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and praise worthy in, and about the work, intirely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65873:213"/> unto God; men, even under the terms now specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all things considered, acting at no higher, or not much more high or commendable rate in their repenting, then in accepting meat offered unto them, when they are an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, of drink, when they are athirst. That which hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned many to look upon repentance (and so Faith) as too great and high a work to be performed by men, onely with the aid of such a concourse, or assistance from God, as that declared, pretending that to ascribe it unto men upon such terms, is too high an exaltation of nature, and of the will of man, and derogatory from the grace of God (with the like) is (I verily believe) those most blessed consequences or fruits of it, remission of sins, reconciliation with God, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, salvation, &amp;c. whereas these in respect of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and attainment by Repentance and Faith, onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the abundant grace, goodness, and bounty of God, not at all any intrinsick worth or extraordinary commendable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in the means by which they are attained. For as it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth a special goodness and generousness of disposition in men, liberally or bountifully to reward ordinary or light ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, being willingly performed: so is it an high-convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing argument and proof of the infinite grace and bounty of God, so transcendently to reward those acts of obedience in men, Faith and repentance, being (especially the help and advantages considered, which himself, as hath been said, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth towards them) so inconsiderable, as to bestow his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, with all the inestimable and glorious fruits thereof, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those that shall perform them. And indeed, the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law or rule, according unto which, as being most reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and equitable, God is wont to dispense his rewards, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, it is matter of much more grace and goodness in him to leave men at liberty, either to repent, or not to repent, under, and after all the means and interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures administred by him unto them to work them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then it would be to impose upon them any unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble necessity to repent, or act them upon such terms by his omnipotency in order to their repentance, that there shall be no possibility left them to remain impenitent. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereof is, because when men are at liberty, whether they
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65873:213"/> will repent, or no, in case they shall chuse and practise it, it will be found in the retinew, or species, of those actions, or services, which the wisdom and righteousness of God judge rewardable, and which accordingly he still rewardeth; my meaning is, it will have the nature and consideration of an action morally good, and which the will regularly and freely chuseth and preferreth before the contrary: whereas in case a mans will be carried by God to repentance by a rapt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or irresistibly and indeclinably determined to its action by a forraign power; that which it acteth upon such terms, wants the formality of a moral action, as not proceeding out of the will of him that acteth, and consequently is of that kind or species of action, which by no law of prudence or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is rewardable, nor is rewarded by God. Therefore whereas many please themselves with an invincible conceit that they are the onely magnifiers and exalters of the free grace of God, in teaching and asserting the irresistibility or infrustrability of the power hereof in bringing men to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, making themselves aggreived at those who teach the contrary, as if they were friends (or flatterers rather) of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, and enemies unto grace; the very plain truth is, that themselves by their doctrine do by the grace of God, as that harlot, against whom <hi>Solomon</hi> gave sentence, did by her child, when <hi>she overlayed it by night</hi> (as her adversary charged her) and so destroyed the life of it: whereas the men of their contest and complaint, in their explication of their sense in the case, carefully provide honourable maintenance for this grace, and render it like unto it self, Grace in the highest, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those who receive it; in the mean time ascribing nothing unto corrupt nature, or to the sinful will of man, save onely a bare capacity of being rectified, and reformed, and reduced by the rich grace of God to chuse its soveraign good, and the way that leadeth to it. And this themselves (upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) deny not, onely they imagine these great and gracious effects to be wrought by such an operation, or co-operation of this grace, which is obstructive (as hath been lately hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) to those very ends, which God propounds to himself, and intends by it. But this is a theme which we have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65873:214"/> more largely elsewhere, though not (as far as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) in these papers. But</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> Fifthly, (and lastly) whereas M. <hi>K.</hi> saith▪ <hi>he requires all, enables his Elect</hi> [meaning, and onely these] <hi>to repent,</hi> doth he not make God like unto a man that should go to a thistle to gather figs, or to a thorn for grapes? Or like unto <hi>Diogenes</hi> in his <hi>Cyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> humour, when passing along by the statues of stone, he asked an alms of them, as if they had been so many living and moneyed men? Or doth he suppose that those other, of whom God <hi>requires repentance,</hi> as well as of Mr. <hi>Ks. elect,</hi> are <hi>enabled</hi> by some other to <hi>repent,</hi> though not by God? Or when God <hi>requires repentance</hi> of those, whom he knows (as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> supposeth) want all <hi>ability</hi> to do what is in this case <hi>required</hi> of them, doth he speak ironically or sarcastical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto them, as one insulting over their impotency and weakness? Or how, or by what consideration, or by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of what principle, will Mr. <hi>K.</hi> be able to reconcile such an uncouth and odd saying with the grace, wisdom, and tender compassion of God? The pleas which some of his Co-errants in these points, are wont to insist upon for their relief at this turn, are but as fig-leaves to cover the nakedness or shame of their opinion: they will scarce hold the stitching together. First (say some) though man hath lost his ability or power of obeying, yet God hath not forfeited or lost his right of commanding. Therefore he may justly <hi>require</hi> that of men, which they are not able to perform. Again (say the same men, or others of the same) God may require of men that which they are not able to perform, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their weakness and inability in this kind.</p>
               <p>To the former; first, be it true, God hath not lost his right of commanding by the sin or folly of men in doing that, for the demerit whereof they are, or might be, justly deprived by him of their ability of obeying: yet though he hath lost no right of commanding in this case, yet in case men have indeed been devested by him of all ability of obeying him, and are not re-invested again therewith, he may have lost his opportunity of commanding. And it is as far from God, in
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65873:214"/> respect of his wisdom, to do any thing importunely or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably, as it is, in respect of his justice, to do any thing unrighteously. Now a right of doing a thing, may possibly, at least in a sense, be, where there is no conveniency or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of acting according to the priviledge of such right. And wise men will not do any thing they have a right to do, but under circumstances of conveniency and meetness for their action. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> or another man, may have a <hi>right</hi> to answer every pelting pamphlet or other impertinent piece, that comes forth like a man armed with straw and stubble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: but if he be wise, and knows how to contrive his time to any better account, he will wave his <hi>right</hi> in this kind. The Apostle Paul had a right of doing several things mentioned by himself,<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.4, 5, 6, 12. <hi>cum vers.</hi> 15.</note> which yet he judged inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him to do, and accordingly omitted the doing of them. In like manner it no way follows, that because God hath a right of commanding such persons to repent, who have no ability to repent, that therefore he useth this right, and commandeth them accordingly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is a question, which (I suppose) would appose <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> Genius handsomely to resolve; Whether, it being supposed that men are dead, I mean under an irrevocable sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death and condemnation (which is Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition concerning the greatest part of those, of whom he confesseth God <hi>requires repentance</hi>) he hath any <hi>right</hi> (in any tolerable sense of the word, <hi>right</hi>) to <hi>require repentance</hi> of them; at least upon such terms, on which he <hi>requires repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of all men, <hi>viz.</hi> with promise of life and salvation upon condition of obedience. Hath a man any <hi>right</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a promise, whether upon condition, or without, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his avowed intentions, and which himself knows to be impossible that he should become willing to perform? He that shall go about with a great deal of officious impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to entitle a prudent and upright man to such a <hi>right</hi> (if right it must needs be) as this, is he not like to suffer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, in case he expects either thanks, or other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for such a service? Or is not this a true portraicture of the case of those men, who think they do God service (and
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:65873:215"/> doubtless look for no small reward for it) in contending and labouring in the very fire to vest a title, or right of claim, in him to require obedience, with a promise of life and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon performance, of such men, unto whom he knows it is altogether impossible for him to be willing ever to give salvation, as having peremptorily and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably decreed the contrary from eternity?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It doth not sound like a strain of the transcendent righteousness and equity of God, especially in his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and dealing with men, first in a judiciary way, to punish men for an offence committed (and this not by themselves neither, personally considered, but onely by their Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plast, some thousands of years it may be, before they were born) with a devesting them of those gracious abilities, wherewith before they were invested; and then, in order to their further, and more grievous punishment, to impose such things upon them, which without the said abilities, of which he hath despoyled them, he knows to be impossible for them ever to perform. Will any Judge, though taken from unjust men, shew himself so enormously and monstrously un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable in judgment, as first to sentence a man (suppose it be for some great offence against Law) to have his legs cut off; and then to award this further sentence against him, that, when the former shall be executed, and his legs cut off, unless he shall run twenty or fourty miles within an hours space, he shall suffer death by hanging? And yet the men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom we now argue, not content in their doctrine to make God like unto a Judge as prodigiously unreasonable as this, dishonour him yet further with the addition of another strain of unworthiness in the case in hand. For evident it is, from the constant tenour of the Scriptures, that God invites and incourageth wicked men unto Repentance, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of love and gracious intendments towards them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, securing them by his oath that he desireth not their death, or destruction, but their repentance rather, and their life and salvation hereupon. So that to suppose, or teach, that God hath deprived wicked men of all their spiritual abilities, and not re-invested them again with them, and consequently, that
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65873:215"/> they are utterly unable to repent, believe, &amp;c. and yet to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and teach withal, that he requires them to repent upon the terms specified, is not onely to represent him, as prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterously, as importunely, as monstrously cruel and unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as the Judge we speak of, but farther, as exercising the same or the like cruelty with a most serious, yea passionate profession of love, mercy, tenderness of bowels, and great compassions towards those, upon whom it is exercised. They had need be extremely addicted <hi>jurare in verba magistri,</hi> and under a double vow of Credulity to their Treachers, that can open the door of their judgments and consciences unto them, when they knock with such speculations and Doctrines as this.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if it be supposed that God hath a <hi>right</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> wicked men to repent, and supposed withall that they have no power to obey such his command, their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in this case cannot reasonably be imputed unto them, nor they become liable to punishment hereby; both which are broadly contrary to the constant tenour and imporr of the Scriptures, where <hi>God</hi> both sharply reproves, and severely threatens, wicked men, for not hearkening unto him, when he invites and calls them to repentance. When <hi>Christ</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Lazarus</hi> being now dead and in his grave, to come forth <hi>(Lazarus, come forth)</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 11.43.</note> had <hi>Lazarus</hi> sinned, or contracted the guilt of any disobedience, in case he had not done as he was commanded, it being supposed that <hi>Christ</hi> had not first quickened him, and invested him with a power whereby he was inabled to <hi>come forth?</hi> Or, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, that <hi>he that is dead, is justified</hi> [so the original] or freed [so our translation] <hi>from sin,</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Rom. 6.7.</note> is not his meaning, that persons in the state of death, being hereby devested of all ability to yeild obedience unto commands, are not in a capacity of <hi>sinning,</hi> or transgressing any law? Where there is no power of obeying, there is no guilt in disobeying. Nor doth it make any difference in this case, whether men have sometimes had power in this kind, and have been justly devested of it for their sin, or no. For such a devestiture or deprivation of power, argueth indeed the greatness of the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:65873:216"/> demerit of that sin, for which so great a punishment or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was inflicted: but it proveth not any demerit at all in any after-omission of obediential acts to such commands, which are now, upon the supposal of such a deprivation, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be performed. For the estimate of such omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is the same, whether he, in whom they are found, hath formerly bin invested with power to obey, or not; these being to be measured or judged of, not by any circumstance so ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relative to them as an investiture with a former power to have avoided them, though in conjunction with a just devesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hereof, but by the present state, condition, or capacity of the person relating to them; w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> standing in an utter impoten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy to obey, the said omissions, are, &amp; must needs be, the same, whether this impotency be natural, or by a forcible &amp; strong, though just hand, inflicted. And it is very questionable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Law, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> inflicteth death upon him that slayeth a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in his drunkenness, and not rather upon him that shall be drunken, be according to the standard, I mean, the true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Law of nature, and sound reason. For as the actings of a phrenetick person, or of a man distraught in his senses, as such, are not so much the actings of the man, as of his distemper; so neither are the doings of a drunken man, as such, so properly the actings of the man, as of his drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And if there be no law, or at least if there ought to be none, for the punishment of phrensie, however contracted; neither ought there to be any for the punishment of any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages or mis-actings of phrenetick persons. So likewise whether the Lapsed Angels, or Divels be <hi>intra,</hi> or <hi>extra sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum demerendi,</hi> capable of sinning, or no (I mean, capable so as to contract any additional or further guilt by any new act of sinning) will admit a doubtfull disputation, not onely because they seem to be under no promise of reward in case of their obedience, and therefore not under any Law of God, (properly so called, or which being disobeyed causeth wrath or punishment, every such Law as this, promising a reward to the observers of it) but also because they have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived by God of all their obediential abilities, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under, or sealed up in an invincible impenitency and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65873:216"/> obduration. So that however that which they act and do be mischeivous, and materially sinfull: yet inasmuch as God neither requires, nor expects, any rewardable obedience at their hand, more then he doth at the hand of any inanimate or irrational creature, it seems very agreeable both to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and justice, that acting onely agreeable to their present natures, and unchangeable frame of their being, as toads and serpents do, what they act in this case should be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rather as their punishment and misery, then as their sin or disobedience. And if wicked and graceless men be by any decree of God so concluded under their present infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and impenitency, that they are in no capacity, no possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity either of believing, or repenting (which is Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Faith, it seems, concerning the far greater part of them) I cannot understand, by what rule of equity, reason, or justice, non-believing, or non-repenting, should be reputed sinful, or made punishable. For if God should punish them for the want of their former ability to obey, or (which is the same) for want of obeying, when their power of obeying hath been taken away from them by himself, should he not, the matter duly weighed and interpreted, rather punish them the second time for being punished by himself formerly, then for any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-sin committed by them?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, (and lastly for this) It is not true, no not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> own principles (at least if these may be esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by his pen) that wicked and ungodly men have lost any power of repenting that was ever given to them, or vested in them. For if such men were at any time, or in any consideration, possessed of, or invested with any power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting above what at present they have, it must be in respect of their seminal being in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and this when and whilest <hi>Adam,</hi> and they in him, stood in their integrity. For when, or in what other sense or consideration, they should have been invested with the privilege or happiness mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hath not (I presume) been yet heard of, nor is easie for a man of as multifarious a phantasie, as Mr. <hi>K.</hi> himself, to imagine. But that they were not invested with any such privilege or power, as that we speak of, nor capable of any
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65873:217"/> such investiture in <hi>Adam,</hi> doth not Mr. <hi>K.</hi> himself very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culently teach us, where he saith, that <hi>Adam in the state of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency was not capable of Faith in a Redeemer?</hi> If he were not capable of Faith in a Redeemer, neither was he capable of Repentance; faith and repentance being alike evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall, and of a mutual concomitancy in the same person, and taught joyntly by the Apostles in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospel. Thus much for stopping the mouth of that irrational plea, which obtrudeth, that though man hath lost his power of obeying, yet God hath not lost his right of commanding.</p>
               <p>Concerning the other pretence, that <hi>God may require of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> men that which they are not able to perform, to convince them of their weakness and inability in this kind,</hi> that neither hath this any worth, or weight, of reason in it, may be made evident like wise.</p>
               <p>First, The end, which this plea pretends to be, or that it may be, intended by God in the act or dispensation here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed unto him, is not attainable by it. For men may have a sufficiency of strength and ability to do that, which yet they may neglect, or omit to do. When God required of <hi>Adam</hi> to forbear eating <hi>of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,</hi> his non-obedience was no conviction, or proof to him, that therefore he wanted power to obey. So when he required of the Angels now reprobate and fallen, a regular and due subordination unto himself, and not to attempt any lifting up of themselves above the line of their creation, their diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience hereunto was no conviction, or eviction, to them, that therefore they were not able to yield obedience unto the Divine command, or to have contented themselves with their first habitation, or estate. Ability for action necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates no man to act: therefore no mans non-acting, can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince or prove a want of ability to act. Want of will to act, may hinder or keep men from action, as well as want of power. And this is the true reason (I mean, their want of will to repent) why so many wicked and ungodly men as remain impenitent, repent not, not their want of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65873:217"/> power. And therefore Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is far out of the way both of reason, and of the truth, when he conceives that God onely <hi>requires repentance</hi> of all other persons, and enables none but his <hi>Elect</hi> to <hi>repent.</hi> It is true, he makes none actually or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually willing to <hi>repent,</hi> but onely those who do repent, who upon their <hi>repentance,</hi> become his <hi>Elect:</hi> but this proves nothing but that others also are as well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to <hi>repent,</hi> as these. If Master <hi>Kendal</hi> here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies; that God doth not <hi>enable</hi> others so much as to be <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> to <hi>repent;</hi> I answer, If God doth not enable others to be willing to repent, then are they not under any guilt of sin for their not being willing in this kind. For it is no sin in the creature not to act impossibilities, or not to act beyond or above any strength or ability that is given them. Nor is Gods denial, or withholding of his Grace from any creature, the sin of this creature. If it be said, but it may be the sin of the creature is the reason or cause why he withholdeth his grace from it; I answer, first, were it granted that the sin of the creature did justly occasion or move God to deny his grace to it, yet this proveth not, that any thing unavoidably done, or not done, by this creature, thorow this denial or withholding of grace from it, is sin, or sinful, in it. If a man hath had his right hand struck off for some misdemeanor punishable by law and justice in this kind, his not working afterwards with his hands is not blame-worthy or justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable also in him. But of this lately. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, If it be the sin of the creature which moveth God to withhold his grace from it, and upon this account the creature necessarily, either acteth, or omitteth, any thing contrary to what the law of God requireth of men, it must be supposed, either that this creature had power or ability of grace from God to have avoided this sin, which is supposed to have the sad influence upon his justice, or not. If it be supposed (in the affirmative) that this creature had power and sufficiency of grace to have avoided that sin, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to have performed the act of obedience opposite to it, and yet supposed withall that he did perpetrate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it; it undeniably follows that then men may sin with,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65873:218"/> or under, a sufficiency of grace to avoid it, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that those may remain impenitent, whom God enableth, or hath enabled, to repent. If it be supposed (in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) that the creature we speak of had not power or suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of grace to have avoided the sin, for which the grace of God is supposed to be withheld from it, then (according to the tenour of our former arguing) was not this sin imputable unto it, or punishable by God, the creature (as was said) not being chargable with sin for not acting impossibilities, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the strength given unto it. Nor can it here be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it was the sin of this creature that brought this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, or caused God to withhold that grace from it, which was necessary for the preserving it from sinning in the case, because then that grand absurdity in reason, which we call <hi>Processus in infinitum,</hi> will follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; or else we must come to stop at, or pitch upon, some one sin in this creature, which was not committed by it thorow any deficiency of grace, or ability from God to have avoided it. And if it be granted, or supposed, that any one sin was committed by the creature, under, or without a sufficiency of grace to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided it, I believe it will appose both Mr. <hi>Ks. Ingeniolum,</hi> and his <hi>Eruditiunculam</hi> also, to give a substantial reason why the other sins of this creature may not be perpetrated and committed upon the same terms; I mean, with, and under, a sufficiency of grace, and enabling from God, to avoid them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I would know upon what account, or in order to what end, God should propound to himself the endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to convince graceless and wicked men, such who he hath no intent should ever be converted, of their inability to keep his commandments. Why should he desire, or attempt such a conviction as this, in such men? It cannot be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he desireth it in order to their humiliation, or to the working of their judgments and consciences for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of themselves to himself for supplies of such strength &amp; abilities, as they want in this kind: for both these and such like effects have a very near, if not necessary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with conversion. If it be said, he may desire it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their condemnation, or to the greater or further
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:65873:218"/> manifestation of his justice therein; I answer,</p>
               <p>First, That God desireth not their condemnation it self:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> therefore he cannot desire any thing in order thereunto, or for the procuring of it. He professeth most seriously and solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea, to put an end to all strife between parties contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the business, with an oath for confirmation, that <hi>he desireth not the death of the wicked, or of him that dieth.</hi> Ezek. 18.23, 32. cap. 33.11. Nothing can be desired by a person for the obtaining of such an end, which it self is not desired by him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Neither hath such a <hi>conviction,</hi> in case it be wrought in, or upon, a wicked man, as that pleaded for, any thing in it for the manifestation of Gods justice in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, in case this were desired by him, unless it be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed withal, that this wicked person should have a sufficiency of power upon, and by means of such a conviction, to repent and be converted; which I believe is no part of Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> faith. For nothing can manifest or commend justice in the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a person, unless the crime, for which he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, were so voluntary, that it was in his choice or power, not to have committed it. It is no manifestation or commendation of justice to punish a man for not doing that which was impossible for him to do. And if the will of a man be so servilely enslaved &amp; subjected to one part of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction (determinately) that he hath no liberty to chuse the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, what he acteth in this case, is not so much volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary as spontaneous, and of no other consideration, nor more punishable, then the actings of horse or mule, or other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without reason and understanding. The frivolous plea of a mans being himself accessory to his inability, or loss of liberty in this kind, either in his first Progenitor, <hi>Adam,</hi> or in himself, was lately outed.</p>
               <p>By the tenor and purport of this whole discourse it is fully evident, that no sufficient or competent reason can be given why God should require <hi>Repentance,</hi> or other subjection to his commands of wicked or unregenerate men, unless it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, first, that such men are, either immediately, or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, qualified, or enabled by him with power to yeild obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:65873:219"/> unto him herein; and secondly, that himself desireth this obedience from them. Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> Divinity saith that God <hi>requires Repentance of all men,</hi> but denies that God <hi>desires</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of all. Is Mr. <hi>K.</hi> wont to require that of any man, which he desires not to receive from him? Or can he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to allow himself more reason, and candour of mind, then God? But the very truth is, that the whole pile and fabrick of his Divinity bears hard and heavy upon the honor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of God.</p>
               <p>In those few passages cited from him, and considered in this chapter, that slie and unhandsome strein of his <hi>Genius</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth it self, which teacheth &amp; disposeth him to deliver &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the clear sense of his adversaries in such a covert and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived way, that his reader, less acquainted with their notions and Tenents, may think that all the while he is arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; and that he confounds them over head and ears, whilest he is their Advocate, onely translating their mind and meaning into his own language and words. No small part of his book harpeth upon this string, and maketh (I believe) some of the best melody which his book affordeth, in the ears of the judgement and understanding of the greatest part of his Readers.</p>

               <p>He tells his <hi>ever-honoured Mother (Exeter Colledge)</hi> and her <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> children, that they <hi>will find a pair of sheers, and a mete-yard, by which</hi> he saith <hi>he means a little logick and Philosophy,</hi> &amp;c. He that by a <hi>bare pair of sheers, and a mete-yard,</hi> means <hi>a little lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and Philosophie,</hi> had as much need to unfold the riddle of his Rhetorick, as the Painter had to interpret the mystery of his work, who drew the pourtraictures or shapes of two crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with such profoundness of art, that for the beholders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, he thought it necessary to write under the one, this is the cock; and under the other, this is the bull.</p>
               <p>He tells his Reader, that <hi>if there be now and then a little too much salt, yet there is</hi> (he is <hi>sure) no Pepper sprinkled thorowout his discourse.</hi> It had been somewhat, though (I confess) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, to my edification, if he had here also interpreted what he meant by <hi>Pepper,</hi> in opposition unto <hi>salt, sprinkled thorowout</hi> his discourse. But the <hi>salt</hi> he here speaks of would have done well to have seasoned <hi>The marrow-bone of his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (another very insulse Metaphor in the following page.) Wherewith notwithstanding he is so affectionately taken, that he followeth it yet further, saying, <hi>the splinters of this bone are like to go down not over-pleasantly thorow the Readers throats,</hi> &amp;c. as if men use to eat the <hi>Marrow-bones</hi> themselves, and not the <hi>Marrow</hi> in the bones; Or what is it in the <hi>Marrow,</hi> which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> means by <hi>splinters, not like to go over-pleasantly down the Readers throat?</hi> Many of Mr. Ks. Metaphors are as rugged, hard and harsh, as any the <hi>splinters of the marrow-bone of my matter,</hi> and yet he makes no question (I question not) but that they will go down pleasantly enough his Readers <hi>throat.</hi> He tells the <hi>Rector of Exceter Colledge</hi> (as we lately
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65873:221"/> heard) that <hi>he presents my Plumes unto him to new stuff the old cushion of his learned predecessors.</hi> What may we reasonably imagine that Mr. <hi>K.</hi> should mean by the <hi>Rectors learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors old cushion?</hi> Or what is the thing resembled in this comparison? By his <hi>old Cushion,</hi> he cannot mean an <hi>old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,</hi> litterally and properly so called. For what <hi>Plumes</hi> hath he <hi>pluckt down</hi> from me <hi>to stuff</hi> such a <hi>cushion,</hi> unless he hath gotten one of my books, and torn out the leaves of it, and sent these to Mr. <hi>Rector,</hi> under the name of <hi>Plumes,</hi> to <hi>stuff</hi> the <hi>cushion</hi> he speaks of? What more anagogical or mysterious he should mean by his <hi>old cushion</hi> then an old <hi>cushion</hi> indeed, I cannot devise. If by his <hi>old cushion,</hi> he means the honour or reputation of Mr. Rectors <hi>learned Predecessors,</hi> or their worth and parts of learning; who ever expressed either credit, or learning, by the hieroglyphick of an <hi>old cushion?</hi> whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he can be imagined to mean by this <hi>old cushion,</hi> it must needs be somewhat that is empty, and needs <hi>stuffing.</hi> And if by my <hi>Plumes,</hi> he means, my notions, Doctrines, credit, or the like, it seems Mr. Rectors learned Predecessors stand in need of these to supply some defect in their own: otherwise Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> present is but <gap reason="foreign">

For surely by the <hi>horse-fair</hi> he speaks of in this place, he doth not mean an horse-fair properly or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally so called. For, an <hi>Actio sit in agente,</hi> is no <hi>common</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity at such <hi>faires.</hi> His <hi>Ingeniolum</hi> loves to disport it self in tropes and Metaphors: and it may be had lately been at some <hi>horse-fair</hi> properly so called: and by something espied and observed here, was, by the advantage of its own quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and nimbleness of apprehension reminded of some <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocum,</hi> or <hi>analogum,</hi> some other thing, which according to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:65873:222"/> its fansie, related in similitude unto it; yet the truth is, were it not for the commodity here mentioned as <hi>common</hi> as this tropical or Metaphorical fair, An <hi>Actio sit in agente,</hi> we might have gone all the world over and scarce have found it, and if we have found it (for we have onely the assurance of conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in this kind) yet can we not find <hi>fundamentum relationis,</hi> the reason or ground of the Metaphor.

Nor do the head and foot of Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> Metaphor in this place, agree so well as fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the same body should. For who are the <hi>dull jades</hi> he speaks of, in his mystical <hi>horse-fair?</hi> In <hi>horse-fairs,</hi> the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, whether <hi>dull jades,</hi> or palfreyes of better mettal, are not wont to buy, or sell, but to be bought, and sold: <hi>Horse-cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,</hi> or men with <hi>horses</hi> to sell, are of the essence of an <hi>horse-fair,</hi> as well as the horses themselves there.

               <p>Part 2. of his <hi>Sancti Sanciti,</hi> p. 74. He learnedly informes his Reader, that <hi>there is as great an impossibility of the mans drowning</hi> [he means, <hi>in the well in his yard] whiles he is at a thousand miles distance, as of the drowning of the Devil upon Clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor.</hi> A grave advertisement from a Divine! Two or three lines after, that the ridiculousness of the former saying might not want company, he matcheth it thus; <hi>But why a man should be no more afraid of being drowned in a pit or well in his yard, and grounds near adjoyning to his house, then a man that lives at a thousand miles distance, I understand not.</hi> By the reason he subjoyns of his defect of <hi>understanding</hi> in the case, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that he is defective indeed in understanding. For doth he give us any wiser account of that <hi>non-understanding</hi> of his he speaks of, then this? <hi>For why may not a man be drowned in it as he walks in the dark, and hath his head, like as you may be sometimes, and mine I confess, is very often, so full of proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it doth not think of the way? I see not but in this case a man full of thoughts, or in a brown study, may very possibly fall into a well in his yard, as well as knock his head against a post, and cry good wits jump.</hi> Keader, doest not thou think; that Master <hi>Ks. wits,</hi> and the <hi>wits</hi> of <hi>a post,</hi> here jump? For doth he not assigne the possibility of what may be, for a ground or reason of a mans fear that it will be? Cannot he <hi>understand,</hi> why, or how, whilest he lives in <hi>London,</hi> he needs be no <hi>more afraid</hi> of tumbling down headlong from the top of <hi>Pauls,</hi> to the contracting of an irrecoverable creik in his neck, then in case he lived in <hi>Bliss-land,</hi> or the Southermost point of the Cape of <hi>Good Hope?</hi> How is it like that He that cannot <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi> the reason hereof, should comprehend the grounds and reasons of those opinions, in the great questions of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Reprobation, the death of Christ, &amp;c. against which notwithstanding he fights with both his hands? But it is like, that because he <hi>understands</hi> them no better, therefore he hath chosen the method of jesting and deriding, rather then of any
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:65873:223"/> solid or serious arguing, to confute them. And I would willingly know of him, if this question also be not too hard for his <hi>understanding,</hi> whether any man would make a <hi>well in his yard,</hi> or in his <hi>grounds near adjoyning,</hi> or suffer a well, though made to his hand in either, and not rather fill it up, in case he were in any degree <hi>afraid</hi> of being <hi>drowned in it? Fear</hi> (we know) <hi>hath torment,</hi> and surely no man would be <hi>tormented,</hi> that knows so ready and easie a way for his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance or escape, as the non-digging, or the stopping up, of a well in his own <hi>yard,</hi> or <hi>grounds adjoyning.</hi> And what though a man may as <hi>possibly fall into a well in his yard,</hi> as <hi>knock his head against a post,</hi> doth it follow therefore, that he is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of falling into</hi> such <hi>a well?</hi> Or is Mr. <hi>K.</hi> himself <hi>afraid</hi> of every <hi>post</hi> in his house, lest he should <hi>knock his head</hi> against it? Miserable then must his life needs be unto him. But Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> best excuse for writing at this inconsiderable rate here, will be, to say (and haply he may say it with truth) that he was in a <hi>brown</hi> (if not, black) <hi>study,</hi> and had his <hi>head full of proclamations,</hi> whilest he was writing.</p>

And upon this account he brings in by head and shoulders the <hi>Devonshire proverb,</hi> about the <hi>drowning of the Devil upon Clow-moor,</hi> telling us that <hi>this proverb hath had the countenance to report it actually done.</hi> But what he means (besides jearing) by <hi>taking a little swig,</hi> or by the <hi>countenance of a Proverb to report a thing,</hi> if he keeps his own counsel, I am nor like to bewray him.

Why might not <hi>Carletons</hi> learning be aswel signified by his <hi>tippet,</hi> as his <hi>rocket?</hi> or what communion had the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with his learning, more then the former? Yea, in reason the learning of all the men he mentions, <hi>Carleton, Davenant, Hall,</hi> &amp;c. might more properly have been signified by their square caps, then either by their <hi>rockets,</hi> or <hi>scarlet hoods:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those are the coverings and ornaments of their heads, (the appropriate seats of their learning) whereas the other, do but superfluously clothe, or cumber, rather then adorn, such parts of their bodies, which are strangers to their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and know not whether they have, or had, in them any such thing or no. And let me ask Mr. <hi>K.</hi> this plaine questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Why may not an harpe be aswel signified by an harrow, as learning, either by a <hi>rocket,</hi> or <hi>scartlet hood?</hi> Certain I am that the analogy or proportion between the two former is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very whit as obvious and near at hand, as between the two latter; unless Mr. <hi>K.</hi> digs deeper for his Metaphors, then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary men are aware. Or it may be, that a superstitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit having taken Mr. Ks. head that there is some magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal virtue in such accoutrements, as <hi>rockets and scarlet hoods,</hi> to draw learning to them, he was admonished hereby to part with his money, and venture his credit, to purchase that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity commodity, which they call <hi>Doctoratus,</hi> a <hi>Doctor-ship,</hi> this investing him with a passable title to a <hi>scarlet hood;</hi> and this again hopefully leading towards a <hi>rocket,</hi> if ever that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament should be again in fashion, and the dry root of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:65873:224"/> watered with Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> good wishes, again bud and bring forth fruit in the land. His two Metaphors on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the way, the one of <hi>green aprons,</hi> the other of <hi>stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min peticoats,</hi> are altogether as pedantick, childish, light, and absurd, as the former. What? a grave Divine, standing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his tip-toes to reach the high honour of a Doctorship, and being now hot in pursuit of solemn and sacred ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to argue and vindicate so important and weighty a point in Christianity, as the Perseverance of the Saints is, to give over this chase, and turn aside to handle <hi>green aprons,</hi> and <hi>stammin peticoates,</hi> in stead of the heavenly subject that was new before him? Oh, Master <hi>Kendal!</hi> take heed that the <hi>green aprons</hi> and <hi>stammin peticoates,</hi> which now you so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely and un-provoked deride, do not one day rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you and condemn you.

               <p>Part 2. p. 152. of his former book, he compares the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> of God towards those, whom he calls, his <hi>Elect,</hi> unto broad-cloath: and his patience towards others, whom he terms, Reprobates, unto <hi>Grogram.</hi> The passage may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably prove a good receit to charm the spirit of Melancholie; if the Reader suffers under such a distemper, I shall admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster it unto him with my pen. Thus Mr. <hi>K. verbatim. Call you this</hi> [speaking of the much long-suffering of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the vessels fitted for destruction, asserted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22.] <hi>Call you this as great, or greater patience, then he shewes towards his Elect? Though it be longer, yet it is much narrower. (Two yards of Grogram is not so much as one of broad-cloath. You reckon as that good old Doctor, that you need not have more yards of Grogram, then broad-cloath in a gown of the same dimensions.)</hi> Sir, <hi>Gods patience towards reprobates is but patience by halves, patience partie per pale, patient wrath, or wrathful patience,</hi> &amp;c. Here are sundry express linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the natural face of Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> learning.</p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:65873:225"/>
               <p>First, He argues from his two notions, or conceits, the one, of Election, the other, of Reprobation, with as much confidence, as if he had either won them by conquest and dint of argument from his Adversary, or else presum'd that his Adversary were as much given up to a traditional &amp; injudicious mind, as himself; or strain'd at nothing, which he swallowed. The Spirit of this Logick is one of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars, attending him at his right hand all along his book. He oft builds very high in Confidence against his adversary: but his buildings in this kind stand (for the most part) upon such foundations, which his adversary scruples, questions or denieth as much (or more) as any other thing in controversie between them. Whereas a regular Disputant, who argueth either out of hope, or desire, to gain his adversary, should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver argue but upon principles agreed upon on both sides, or at least owned by his adversary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He cavils at my assertion, that God <hi>shewes the same, or greater patience towards such persons who are not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> (in his <hi>sense</hi>) which he sheweth unto those who are: and imagines that he sufficiently confuteth me, by his new-found and groundless distinction between the <hi>greatness,</hi> and muchness, or <hi>length</hi> of Gods <hi>patience.</hi> For unto that pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or long-suffering of God towards those who never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which the Apostle calls <hi>much,</hi> he opposeth the patience of God, which is <hi>great</hi> [or, which he calls, <hi>great] Though it be longer</hi> (saith he) <hi>yet it is much narrower.</hi> New distinctions or oppositions, had need have full and clear explications: Whereas first, Master <hi>Kendal</hi> tells us news, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us aswel of <hi>latitudo</hi> as <hi>longitudo</hi> found in the patience of God, yea and of an opposition of contrariety between them: and yet secondly gives us not so much as the least glimmering of light, whereby to see, how, or wherein, the long-suffering or patience, and the great and broad-suffering or patience of God, differ, and consist. His <hi>grogram</hi> and <hi>broad-cloath</hi> serve rather to make curtains and coverings to veil his mind in his said distinction, then to adorn, commend, or set it forth. But uncouthness, obscurity, and irrationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, such as <hi>patient wrath, wrathfull patience,</hi> &amp;c. turn'd off
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:65873:225"/> hand without the least regret, remorse, or observation, are no rarities in Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> writings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If I should <hi>reckon as that good old Doctor</hi> he speaks of, yet I might be as wise an Arithmetician, as the good new Doctor (Doctor <hi>Kendal</hi>) when he reckons <hi>two yards of gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram not so much as one of broad-cloath;</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of Mr. Ks. cōparison borrowed from between the Weaver and Woollen-Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who deals in Grograms, of what breadth the broadest of them were; his answer was, that there were some a yard and half quarter broad. So that when <hi>Mr.</hi> K. saith, <hi>two yards of grogram are not so much as one of broad-cloath,</hi> he had need either shrink his <hi>gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gam,</hi> or else stretch his <hi>broad cloath</hi> beyond the staple of it, to make his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison cōmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable with the truth.</note> or at least when he reckons the <hi>patience</hi> of God towards those who despise it (who are Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> Reprobates from eternity) to be much <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower,</hi> thought it be <hi>longer,</hi> then that which he sheweth or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth towards those who repent by the opportunity of it. Fot if it be <hi>longer,</hi> is it not larger? and if it be larger, is it much <hi>narrower?</hi> Or when the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians, You see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand,</hi> doth he not by a <hi>large letter,</hi> mean a <hi>long</hi> letter? But <hi>large,</hi> and <hi>narrow,</hi> are (it seems) a pair of Mr. <hi>Ks. Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyma.</hi> And how, or in what respect, he should notion or fancy the <hi>patience of</hi> God, where it is <hi>longer,</hi> to be yet <hi>narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> had we not need send to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> [or, if ye will, <hi>Bedlam</hi>] for a prophet to divine? A man had need have a crack, or open place in his brain, as well to let in, as to let out, such a mysterious and profound crotchet as this. But</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Doth he not more then despise, or any whit less then blaspheme, the <hi>Patience</hi> of God, when he calls it, <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by halves, patience partie per pale, patient wrath, wrathful patience,</hi> &amp;c. Or is not this <hi>patience</hi> of God, which he thus ignominiously entreateth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileth, the same with that, of which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so reverently, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Or despisest thou the riches of his boun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifulness and forbearance</hi> [or, patience: for so our former tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation readeth] <hi>and long-suffering, not knowing that the bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</hi> Or doth not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speak here of that <hi>patience,</hi> which God exerciseth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> Reprobates? Let the context speak: and first, the verse immediately preceding; and then, the verse immediately following. The verse preceding gives this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: <hi>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them, which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65873:226"/> of God?</hi> The subsequent verse, thus: <hi>But after thy hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thy self wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</hi> Are Master <hi>Kendals</hi> Reprobates better, or worse, then those, who <hi>after their hardness, and impenitent heart trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure up unto themselves wrath against the day of wrath,</hi> &amp;c. If they be neither better nor worse, but the same (as himself, unless either his <hi>cor,</hi> or <hi>caput,</hi> be out of order, will confess) then is the <hi>Patience</hi> which God sheweth them, such a <hi>patience.</hi> which <hi>leadeth men to repentance</hi> (whether they actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or no: as an horse may be led to the water, or to his drink, whether he drinketh or no.) And if the <hi>Patience</hi> which God sheweth Master <hi>Kendals</hi> Reprobates, be such a <hi>patience</hi> which <hi>leadeth to repentance,</hi> and withall, is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the <hi>riches of his bountifulness.</hi> (which the Apostle here likewise supposeth) I would willingly know of Master <hi>Kendal</hi> how, or in what consideration, it is <hi>much narrower,</hi> then that which he sheweth to his <hi>Elect?</hi> Unto the notion of this question (and indeed to the business he had in hand) doth he not give a clear <hi>go-by,</hi> when he summes up his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thus: <hi>So far is the</hi> defertur <hi>from falling into an</hi> aufertur, <hi>that it ends in a</hi> refertur <hi>with a witness, and reckons with them for the forbearance, as well as for the debt.</hi> Is not his meaning in this gingle, or ring of bells, that the Patience which God sheweth to his Reprobates, is therefore narrower, though it be <hi>longer,</hi> then that which he sheweth to his Elect, because in the end or issue, thorow the great folly and wickedness of those to whom it is shewed, it occasioneth an event of a sad and wofull import, when as his <hi>patience</hi> towards the other, by a contrary use and improvement of it by them, sorteth to a most happy and blessed success? But is the sun, when he hardeneth clay, <hi>much narrower,</hi> then when he melteth wax? Or is the winde <hi>much narrower</hi> when it turneth some trees up by the rootes, then when it fasteneth the rootes of others in the earth: Or doth an accidental difference in point of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent argue an essential or specifical difference in the cause? Mr. <hi>Kendals ingeniolum</hi> is here (indeed) peccant <hi>nimia: distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione</hi> (as himself speaketh) by finding a longitude differing
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65873:226"/> from a latitude in Gods Patience. He hath (it seemes) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the inspiration of his Deanes-chair: or else it was a very illogical spirit that inspired it. But</p>
               <p>Fifthly, (&amp; lastly) I would willingly know of him, whether it be agreeable to the <hi>commonly received doctrine of Reformed Churches,</hi> to revile the <hi>riches of the Patience</hi> of God, with these odious characters and terms, of <hi>Patience by halfs, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence partie per pale, patient wrath, wrathfull patience,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Calvin</hi> a great master, in the <hi>Israel</hi> of the Reformed Churches, speaks (I am certain) much otherwise, of that Patience of God, which Master <hi>Kendal</hi> thus ignominiously asperseth. He affirmeth over and over, that the <hi>counsel</hi> [or intent] of God therein, is <hi>that he may convert sinners unto him:</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it, he termeth, the <hi>making a mock of his immense goodness.</hi> He resolveth the additional punishment of final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-impenitent persons into the sin of their <hi>rejecting the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly invitation of God.</hi>

                  </note> Afterwards he affirms <hi>all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of God</hi> [he speaks of benefits confer'd by him upon Master <hi>Kendals</hi> Reprobates] to be, <hi>totidem paternae ejus bonita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis testimonia, so many testimonies of his Fatherly goodness towards them.</hi> In the same place, his doctrine is, that he sheweth unto, or <hi>entertaineth wicked men with, the same indulgence, which he sheweth unto his Servants</hi> [this is much more then if he had said, to Master <hi>Kendals</hi> elect] and that though <hi>he doth not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declare himself</hi> actually <hi>propitious unto,</hi> or well pleased with them, yet hereby <hi>he calls them to repentance</hi> (with much more, to the shame of Master <hi>Kendals patience by half, patience partie per pale, patient wrath,</hi> &amp;c. But the very truth is, that many the principles or fundamentalls of Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> Divinity, are either blasphemies, or blasphemies-fellowes.</p>
               <p>Part 2. p. 154. He proves that God may properly enough be said to be patient towards his [or rather Master <hi>Kendals</hi>] Elect, whom he supposeth likewise that he loves with the most ardent &amp; unchangeable affection, though in the greatest height and heat of wickedness, although he knows it to be impossible for them to forbear sin and wickedness in the highest, until he comes with an irresistible hand of Grace upon them to enable them hereunto; this knowledge (I
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:65873:227"/> say) of God concerning his Elect notwithstanding, Master <hi>Kendal</hi> proves that he may properly enough be termed <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> towards them, by this jear and parable. <hi>We had thought</hi> (saith he) <hi>he might be said to be a patient husband that ardently &amp; affectionately loves his wife that cannot forbeare scolding till he have gagged her, nor biting, till he hath drawn out her teeth, nor setting his house on fire, till he have restrained her from fire and candle; but, saith</hi> Master Goodwin, <hi>no, this is not worth the name of patience in an husband.</hi> If it were asked, whose image and superscription this similitude, with the dress of it, hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; he that knows Master <hi>Kendal</hi> though but competent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, might readily answer, Master <hi>Kendals.</hi> For here are four of the lineaments of his complexion, or face; jearing, non-sense, impertinency, and untruth: if we had in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction but a broad-faced contradiction also, we should have his intire and complete feature.</p>
               <p>First, when he saith in the beginning of the passage, <hi>We had thought he might be said to be a patient husband,</hi> &amp;c. he insinuates, with a jear, that I am so simple and inconsiderate, as not to comprehend with his perspicacious and learned self and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that obvious and plain <hi>thought</hi> which here he declares and whereof he asserts the mastership or belief unto himself and his party. Again, the close of it, where he saith, Master <hi>Goodwin saith, no,</hi> [to his assertions] <hi>this is not worth,</hi> &amp;c. he be-jears me, as if I denied the Sun to be up at noon-day, when as he and his party with so much ease and confidence affirm it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Is there any thing beyond the line of non-sense, in the tenour or carriage of the passage it self? Or is not the thought, the thinking whereof he so impotently congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to himself and his party, with a disdainful reflexion of shame and disparagement upon <hi>me,</hi> for not casting in my lot with them therein, is not (I say) this <hi>thought,</hi> the <hi>thought</hi> of a man, in whose ears common sense and reason, when they speak clearest, and lowdest, give no distinct sound? For must he needs be <hi>a patient</hi> husband, that <hi>ardently and affectionately loves his wife that cannot forbear scolding, till he gagges her?</hi> What if he presently <hi>gagges</hi> her, or (in Master <hi>Kendals</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65873:227"/> and language) <hi>cannot forbear</hi> to gagge her, as soon as ever she begins to <hi>scold?</hi> Will Master <hi>Kendal</hi> and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty say; we had <hi>thought that</hi> such a man <hi>might be said to be a patient husband?</hi> Or is it such an high strain of <hi>patience,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to fall foul, or heavy, upon a person, whom we affectionately love, upon the first of their provoking us? Besides, where did Master <hi>Kendal</hi> ever see, or hear of such a <hi>wife, which could not forbear scoulding, till her husband gagged her?</hi> Possibly (though not probably neither) he may have known, or heard of, such a wife, who <hi>would not forbear scoulding,</hi> till either her <hi>husband,</hi> or some other person, <hi>gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her.</hi> But never was there a woman heard of, that <hi>could not,</hi> or to whom it was impossible to, <hi>forbear scoulding, till she was gagged,</hi> but onely she, whom Master <hi>Kendal</hi> hath here made of ink and paper, inspir'd with a wild and inconsiderate fancy, to act a part of impertinency upon the theatre of his book. But Master <hi>Kendal</hi> (it seemes) hath married, <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi> and <hi>Will not:</hi> so that to him, they are no more two, but one flesh, and one spirit: But Master <hi>Calamies</hi> Sermon, wherein, he so mightily distinguisheth between these two, that he makes <hi>Cannot,</hi> accessary to no mans condemnation, but chargeth the blood of all souls that perish, upon <hi>Will not,</hi> riseth up in judgment against Master <hi>Kendals</hi> book and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth it. Again, with what authority or countenance, either from reason, or common sense, doth Master <hi>Kendal</hi> make <hi>ardent and affectionate love</hi> an argument of <hi>patience? Christ</hi> saith to the Church of <hi>Laodicea; As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten, Rev.</hi> 3.19. And the Apostle concerning God: <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth, Heb.</hi> 12.6. Therefore greatness of <hi>love</hi> is no proof of <hi>patience;</hi> except rebukes, chastenings, and scourgings, be proofs likewise. It is true, God who doth rebuke, chasten, and scourge, is <hi>patient:</hi> but not because, or as, he doth any of these. Nor doth it at all argue an <hi>Husband, patient, ardently and affectionately to love his wife, who cannot forbear scolding, till he gagges her.</hi> If it be his duty to <hi>gagge</hi> her for <hi>scolding,</hi> or to keep her from <hi>scolding,</hi> in case he presently doth the execution, this doth not argue him <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:65873:228"/> in case he deferrs it, neither doth this argue <hi>patience.</hi> For <hi>patience</hi> being a <hi>vertue</hi> (as Master <hi>Kendal</hi> himself acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it to be, though he blasphemeth the honour of it, by calling it a <hi>dull vertue</hi>) no neglect of duty can be an argument or proof of it.</p>
               <p>If Master <hi>Kendal</hi> here reply; it may be his duty to gagge her, but not presently upon her beginning to scold, but after some convenient time spent by her in this exercise; and to forbear her until now, may argue him patient: I answer, if he knows that she <hi>cannot forbear scolding, until he gaggeth her,</hi> upon what account, or to what purpose, should he <hi>forbear</hi> her in her sin, for any space of time at all? should he not by <hi>forbearing to gagg</hi> her in such a case, suffer sin to rest upon her, and this knowingly; yea and seemingly at least, if not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also, comport with her in her sin? Now to <hi>suffer</hi> sin, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially knowingly, to rest upon any person; much more to comport with this person, whether in appearance or in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in their course of sinning, cannot proceed from the grace or vertue of <hi>patience,</hi> nor from any principle necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily accompanying <hi>Patience,</hi> and consequently can be no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or signe of it.</p>
               <p>If it be not the duty of Mistress <hi>Kendals husband to gagge</hi> his wife for <hi>scolding,</hi> neither <hi>nunc,</hi> nor <hi>tunc, i.</hi> not at all, Why doth he compare God to him that shall do it? yea, or why doth he cast the honour of being a <hi>patient husband</hi> upon him, that shall act contrary to that which is his duty onely, for suffering this sinful acting for a time? So that Mr. <hi>Kendals</hi> simile of a <hi>patient husband and scolding wife,</hi> hath neither head nor foot of sense in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor is this simile at all pertinent to the cause he had in hand. In the beginning of the same period he had told me, that <hi>it might serve to tell me</hi> [he thinks, it seems that any thing that pleaseth him to say, will <hi>serve to tell me] If we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be said to be patient for not punishing them, I yet hope we may well enough be said to be patient for continuing to love them, who are so bent on actions prejudicial to us, as they will not hold their hands, till we bind them for them.</hi> Though this saying be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous enough, and neither smooth for sense, nor close for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65873:228"/> answer to what it pretends, this relative opposition; yet is not the purport of it (so far as sense ruleth in it) cleared or illustrated by the said <hi>simile.</hi> For in this saying, he placeth the reason or ground why a man may reasonably be termed <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> in the continuance of his love to those that are bent on actions prejudicial to him, thorow the frowardness or evil disposition of their wills who are thus bent: whereas in his similitude he will needs have the Husband worthy the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Patient,</hi> because he <hi>ardently and affectionately loves his wife,</hi> who is bent upon <hi>scolding,</hi> not simply tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the pravity, or present frowardness of her will, but through want of power to <hi>forbear scolding,</hi> or to do otherwise. Now there is as great a difference (as was lately hinted, and attested by the authority of no meaner man then Master <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>) between want of will, and want of power, to forbear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or to perform that which is good, as is lightly imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So that though it should be granted, that he may be termed a <hi>patient</hi> man, who continues to love those that <hi>are bent upon actions prejudicial to him,</hi> thorow the evil frame and temper of their wills (although I presume such a notion as this to be neither rush nor branch of the <hi>commonly received Doctrine of the Reformed Churches</hi>) yet it follows not from hence, that he also deserves a crown of the same honour, who continues his love to those who are bent upon like actions thorow an impossibility of altering or changing their fixt frame, unless they be by a strong hand compelled here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by him. In case Mr. <hi>K.</hi> were a Prince, and should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand some of his servants, or subjects whom he most respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, to make themselves wings and fly over <hi>Pauls</hi> steeple; in case they should not do what Mr. <hi>K.</hi> commands them in such a kind, Mr. <hi>K.</hi> should notwithstanding continue his love and respects unto them, should he deserve the name or repute of a patient man for it? But in case he should require some reasonable service of them, and which lay within the compass of their power to perform, and this without any great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, or detriment to them, so that their disobedience might evidently be concluded to proceed onely from their disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, stubbornness, or frowardness of their wills, in this case
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:65873:229"/> if M. <hi>K.</hi> should continue his former love and respects towards them, it would carry a much better semblance of patience in it, then his doing the like in the other. The reason of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is so near at hand, that I count it needless by any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to bring it nearer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, (&amp; lastly) whereas in the winding up of his three-thrid simile, his daring conscience adventures upon these words; <hi>But</hi> saith M. <hi>Goodwin, no, this is not worthy the name of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in an husband,</hi> the truth is, that I never gave sentence, nor yet my sense, either in the negative, or affirmative, in the case propounded by him, nor did I ever hear the like case put by any man: nor do I think that I shall ever again hear, either the same, or its fellow, proposed by any man, unless (haply) it be by <hi>Idem qui pridem.</hi> So that here we see plainly, and (as it were face to face) the fourth, and last, and worst, of the four lineaments of Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> face mentioned; the name of it, is in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and in English, the speaking of untruth.</p>
               <p>We have (I confess) in this chapter ploughed a very bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren soyl. Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> absur'd Metaphors, proverbs, and similes, yeild but a slender increase, either of knowledge, or edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the Reader. Yet in traversing the passages wherein some of them are found, we have met with something, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination whereof may, (as evil manners are oft-times the occasional breeders of good Laws) have brought to light somewhat not unworthy the Readers consideration. However, I shall leave the rest of this field (being the far greater part of it) untill'd, for pasture, to feed such of his friends and Readers, as can find an edifying tast or savour in his ridiculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities and absurdities. There is enough of this up and down his book to feed such cattel fat.</p>

               <p>The valour of Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> learning much resembleth the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent courage of this souldier. For all along his longsome discourse, (at least as far as I have yet had leasure to search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it) he very prudently and without noise, gives the main stress and strength of his Adversaries arguments a fair go-by, much after the manner of the lap-wing, which the better to keep her nest from being found, makes the fiercest cry when she is at a distance from it. Master <hi>Kendal</hi> is very busie, full of heat, layeth on pen apace in beating up the out-quarters of an argument, and in discoursing some vulgar notion, which every man knoweth, and his adversaries constantly profess as well as he, but the heart and soul, the spirit and strength of an argument, where it biteth and pincheth, he (for the most part) cometh not near (as the proverb is) by forty foot. Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whom (to use his own phrase) he had by going out of his way, the <hi>ill luck</hi> to make his adversary, takes him tardy at this point in that little wherein he had to do with him;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65873:230"/> For p. 120. <hi>Sect.</hi> 56. of his <hi>Reduction of a Digressor,</hi> he finds just occasion to complain of him unto him thus. <hi>But now I come to the great business, I find you as mute as a fish.

The same most worthy and grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (I mean, Master <hi>Baxter</hi>) had before this, in his said Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, [<hi>viz.</hi> p. 95. <hi>Sect.</hi> 32.] complained of the like tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation in him. <hi>But when I had read to the end, I could scarce perceive certainly whether ever you spake to the point at all; or at least in so few syllables, and so obsurely, that I am uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I understand what you mean, I confess you left me between admiration and indignation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Part 1. p. 46. &amp; p. 47. He makes severall coverings of this <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> kind of subtile tergiversation, to hide his ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency to give a direct and distinct answer to his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. To my assertion, that the <hi>beings of things, at least a great part of them, are not so absolutely determined by God, as to the number of them in their production, as they are in their natures, or principles constitutive of their beings,</hi> he gives this go-by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of an answer. <hi>But do you think in earnest</hi> (saith he) <hi>that a grain falls upon the Earth, or thrives in it without the providence more then the dew of Heaven?</hi> What the man means by a <hi>grain thriving in the Earth without the providence more then the dew of heaven,</hi> a man half distracted may (haply) understand; but to him that is composed in his sences, the words, for sense, are parallel to the Authors verses (elsewhere also, for their rarity, presented)

               <p>I believe the gentleman took no great pains, or time, in study, for the compiling of these verses: his Genius seems naturally and freely to pour out non-sense. And what he is here in verse, he is in prose almost in every page of his book, more or less: from whence I conjecture, that the labour of his hand in writing was greater, then the labour of his head in enditing, his two volumes. But if his Printer with his own shame, doth not in the discourse before us relieve him against his, a man may well think that his old infirmity hath again found him out. But in his go-by answer, he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on: <hi>Doth not the hand of God direct the hand of the sower &amp; planter, &amp; give the increase to both as it pleaseth him?</hi> (To grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him w<seg rend="sup">th</seg> a connivence at his English soloecisme here) let us have patience to hear him on a little further in his wry-nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Answer: <hi>Have you one particular grain in your garner, which grew up without God?

Whereas to answer or confirm that opinion, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of mine, which he would bear his Reader in hand that all along he incounters and opposeth, he should have proved, that God hath absolutely determined how many trees every man shall plant in his ground, and so how many corns or kernels of wheat, (and so of every other grain) every man shall sow in his field; so that it were unpossible for any man, either to plant more or fewer trees, or to sow more or fewer kernels of every grain, then such or such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate number, in both kinds.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65873:232"/> and slanderous insultation: <hi>So then this dictate of yours, of men multiplying corn without Gods special providence, is such a piece of chaff, as is fit to be cast into the unquenchable fire.</hi> No, <hi>Mr. K.</hi> no dictate of mine, but every <hi>liar</hi> is such a <hi>piece of chaff,</hi> w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg>
                  <hi>is fit to be cast into the unquenchable fire,</hi> Revel. 21.8. I never <hi>dictated mens multiplying corn without Gods special providence:</hi> yet if this had been my <hi>dictate,</hi> you had given it a go-by; and not confuted it in all your Answer: For in this you onely say (and prove not so much neither) that <hi>men cannot multiply corn without Gods providence.</hi> Men may not be able to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply corn without the providence of God: and yet be able (as indeed they are) to multiply it without his <hi>special provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> unless you will make his general, or his ordinary and standing <hi>providence,</hi> the same with his <hi>special:</hi> which I am certain is no part of the <hi>Doctrine commonly Received in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches;</hi> nor yet of that which is delivered in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>A little after (in the same page) having set before him <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> these words of mine (at least as he transcribes them) <hi>yea the ordinary course and assistance of providence supposed, men have power to multiply individualls in some animal species, and however, to restrain</hi> such a multiplication; he confutes them, by going along with them, yet pretending to give a check, or an affront to them, thus: <hi>True, but this ordinary providence looks to every particular.</hi> But is there the least eye of any opposition in this, unto any thing contained, or intimated, in the words which he would have his Reader think that he learnedly and dexterously opposeth? Or doth his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deny, or seem to deny but that the ordinary providence of God looks to every particular? He goes on (but still by, and besides the business in hand) <hi>and leaves it not in the power of man to destroy, much less to make, a worm without it.</hi> But what is this to prove, that <hi>the ordinary course and assistance of providence supposed, men have not power to multiply individuals in some animal species, or</hi> not <hi>to restrain such a multiplication?</hi> I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that by and with the interposal and concurrence of the ordinary providence of God, men have power, either to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, or to restrain the multiplying of individuals in some
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65873:233"/> animal species. Mr. <hi>K.</hi> to confute this, affirms, <hi>that this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary providence leaves it not in the power of man to destroy, much less to make, a worm without it.</hi> Do not my words, <hi>the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry course and assistance of providence supposed,</hi> clearly imply, that without it, [<hi>i.</hi> this ordinary providence not interposing, or concurring] men have neither power to multiply, nor to restrain the multiplication of individuals, &amp;c? Therefore Mr. <hi>K.</hi> hath here much rather confirm'd my Doctrine, then confuted it. I pass by his weak supposition, that there is no way to <hi>restrain</hi> the multiplication of Creatures, but by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying</hi> them. If when he was a <hi>Country-man,</hi> he was the master of kine, or sheep, did not he know how to restrain the multiplying both of the one, and of the other, without the assistance of the butcher? If he did not, no marvel that he writes at such an inconsiderable rate of sense or reason. I did not think of destroying creatures, when I spake of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining their multiplication. But though Master <hi>Kendals</hi> answer here be but a plain go-by, as well to the words, as sense, of his adversary, yet with what ostentation doth he run division upon it, &amp; makes a long story of his own folly! <hi>And if</hi> (saith he, going on in the way of his imagined An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer) <hi>he</hi> [man] <hi>cannot make or change an hair on his own head, much less can he make or kill a louse without it: this most despicable creature hath too much curious workmanship in it, to be left thus at the meer pleasure of men, without the interposition of a particular, though ordinary providence:</hi> The relativeness of all this to his business in hand, hath been shewed already. And if he were strictly examined about the validity of his argument <hi>a minore ad majus</hi> in the former part of these words, I believe he would give but a very sorry account of it. For upon what ground or principle in reason doth it follow, that if I cannot make or change an hair on my own head, much less can I make or kill a louse without it? What reason can there be, why it should be so much more difficult for me to <hi>kill a louse,</hi> then to <hi>make</hi> or <hi>change an hair on my own head?</hi> I believe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>K.</hi> hath kill'd many more lice, then he hath made hairs on his own head. But when he saith, that <hi>a man cannot make
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65873:233"/> an hair on his own head without it [i.</hi> without the ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God] doth he not plainly, though very erroneously and ridiculously, suppose, that with the ordinary providence of God, he can <hi>make</hi> it? Or would it not be a saying of that kind, which men call <hi>absur'd,</hi> if Master <hi>Kendal</hi> should say, that without the two wings of one of the <hi>Woodcocks</hi> he speaks of, and which were so plentiful in his dayes about <hi>Bodmin</hi> (Part 2. p. 25.) he were not able to fly in the air; when as he is able to fly aswel without them, as with them.</p>
               <p>And wheras he ascribes the providential care of God in <hi>not <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> leaving a louse at the meer pleasure of man,</hi> to the <hi>curious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship in it,</hi> doth he not clearly suppose and imply herein, first, that such creatures which have less curiosity of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship in them, are left by God at the meer pleasure of man? (which is a notion both erroneous in it self, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with his own principles;) and secondly, that the providential care of God over his creatures, is not four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon their simple and bare relation to him, as being his creatures, and the workmanship of his own hands, but upon the exquisiteness or curiosity of their frames? Doubtless nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this any point of the <hi>Doctrine commonly received in the Reformed Churches,</hi> of which Mr. K. would be thought the great <hi>hyperaspistes.</hi> Besides, to call the same creature, <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable creature,</hi> and yet immediately to commend it for <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity of workmanship,</hi> hath no more of a good consistency in it then needs must. And why Mr. K. should make <hi>the louse</hi> so signally sacred to the providential care of God as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, when as the Scripture demandeth, hath <hi>God any care of oxen,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9. yea and elsewhere teacheth, that God <hi>made man to have dominion over the works of his hands, and hath put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field, the fowle of the air, and fish of the sea,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.6, 7, 8.) I believe the best reason he could give would be hardly worth his darling <hi>louse.</hi>

               <p>Part 1. p. 47. Having made himself aggrieved at these <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> words of mine: <hi>Doubtless many persons both of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have been propagated and born into the world, whose Parents were not determined, nor necessitated to their generation;</hi> he jears me, and himself in good earnest, by answering and confuting me thus: <hi>We silly souls</hi> [alas for your silliness!] <hi>have ever taken it for granted, that all mens Names, yea-and members were written in Gods book, before they were fashioned in their mothers womb, that it was God that poured them out like milk, — and this according to his own holy purpose, not the lewd pleasure of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous men and women: We had thought, considering how the providence of God hath made use of Bastards, those Bastards had not been made without the providence of God. — What mean you by this,</hi> that doubtless many persons are not? The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, determine every one, necessitate none, so as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their freedom,</hi> &amp;c. —<hi>Nor is his determining and concurring to any other sinfull action, of a less holy and pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. You that seeme to smile to think how you have non-plust</hi> [doth Master <hi>K.</hi> at any time <hi>smile to think,</hi> or smile in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] <hi>all contradiction in this parlous instance, may upon second thoughts blush at your self for proposing it: and shall doubtless find that even the opposition of Gods providence, was by the same providence ordained for the more illustrious magnifying of the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:65873:235"/> glory of God in the shame of the Opposer.</hi> Thus far Master <hi>K.</hi> here, and too far for a man that is out of his way. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that all this discourse is quite besides the notion and import of my words before him, here is a strain of porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and horrid divinity (especially in the last clause) with other simplicities more then a few.</p>
               <p>First, He informs us, that <hi>they silly souls</hi> [as they are] <hi>have ever taken it for granted that all mens names, yea and members were written in God book before,</hi> &amp;c. There is a sense indeed wherein what he here saith (using some Scripture-words) is true. But first, it is never the more true, because the <hi>silly souls</hi> he speaks of <hi>have ever taken it for granted.</hi> For such <hi>souls</hi> as he, are wont to take many things for <hi>granted</hi> which are desperately false: one instance (at least) whereof increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the shame of the words now transcribed from him. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>All mens names, yea and members,</hi> may be said to be <hi>written in Gods book, before,</hi> &amp;c. And yet no such thing implied hereby, that all <hi>parents are determined, or necessitated to the generation of their children.</hi> For God may and doth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, or fore-know contingencies as well as determined or necessitated events. And the <hi>writing</hi> of things in <hi>his book</hi> before their actuall beings, doth not necessarily imply, or suppose any thing more, then his fore-knowledge of them. And thus <hi>Junius</hi> expounds the Metaphor, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.16. (the place whereunto Master <hi>Kendal</hi> alludes) <hi>ab aeterno cognovisti providentia tua; i.</hi> in, or by thy providence, thou hast known them from eternity. So also <hi>Musculus,</hi> writing upon the words, acknowledgeth that <hi>in his judgment they refer to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of God;</hi> and translateth them thus, <hi>Et in libro tuo omnes conscripti erant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i.</hi> all men were written in thy book, thus expounding them, and in thy prescience we were all foreseen and foreknown. Now the prescience or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God of things not yet in being, but future, in the judgement of all men that I have yet met with, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand themselves so much as competently, in these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, doth not import, or suppose, his determination of these things; nor yet any act of his, by which they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily or unavoidably come to pass, yea or any otherwise,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:65873:235"/> or upon any other terms or after any other manner, then they might, and would have come to pass if (for argument sake) it could be supposed, that they had not been foreseen, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known by him, onely the present course of providence and second causes supposed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nor is it said (in the text lately pointed to) that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> God wrote the things there spoken of in his book, but pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, that <hi>in his book they were all written.</hi> The passive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression seems to insinuate, as on the one hand the infinite perfection of the Divine understanding, so on the other hand, that the knowledge of such things as are there spoken of, (<hi>viz.</hi> things contingent) accrue unto this his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, not by any act or interposure of his bringing them thither, but from, or by means of, the bare futurity of the objects themselves, or the things so understood and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known by him. For as, according to <hi>Aristotle</hi> and true phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie, <hi>intelligere est pati,</hi> to understand imports rather a passion, then an action, the object understood, whatever it be, imprinting, or impressing its species upon the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; So when the understanding of any thing is ascribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, it is to be conceived as if the object or thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by him, shone by its intellectual species upon, or in his understanding; And as, though to understand imports rather <hi>pati,</hi> then <hi>agere,</hi> yet to receive clearly, fully, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly the species of such objects, which are of the most difficult perception, (of which kind, both things of the least and faintest entity, and so things of the fullest and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest entity, are) argues (proportionably) the clearness, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and perfection of the understanding: so doth the knowledge or understanding of future contingencies by God, these (as such) being things of the slenderest and weakest entity, highly commend and demonstrate the adorable excellency of his Divine understanding. Neither do we in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> this (to save Mr. <hi>K.</hi> an impertinent cavil) make any the acts of the Divine understanding, or foreknowledge of God, to depend upon created objects: for first, we place all the acts of his understanding and foreknowledge, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and before the being of any creature: and secondly,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65873:236"/> resolve them, in their causality, partly into his own will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto which he purposed from eternity to give b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing in time unto such and such species, or kinds of creatures, partly into the most transcendent perfection and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensiveness of his understanding it self, by the advantage and means whereof he certainly knows how these intended creatures, being as yet in himself onely [I mean, in his will, and power] will act and work, when he shall please to give them actual being; he knows (I say) how they will all act; yea and how those, to which he intends to give a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional being, and so liberty and freedom of will and action, will use this liberty, and act, and this without his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, limiting or confining them unto their actions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not to be denied, but that sometimes upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occasions he interposeth after a special manner for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint and limitation of some of them in their actings. Thus he limited or restrained <hi>Satan</hi> twice, in <hi>Jobs</hi> case. <hi>Job</hi> 1.12.2.6. So he restrained <hi>Abimelech</hi> from touching <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Gen.</hi> 20.6. So by sending <hi>Abigail</hi> to meet <hi>David</hi> in the heat of his passion, he restrained him from laying violent hands upon <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32, 33. But these and such like particular instances of his restraining, or confining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposure plainly suppose, that in his ordinary or standing Providence, he leaves second causes, and so men and women, to their own proper motions and actings, without any such interposure for their determination, limitation, or confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; according to the rule, <hi>Exceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, (and lastly, to touch this by the way) whereas Master <hi>Kendal</hi> tells us in high confidence, that <hi>they silly souls ever took it for granted that all mens names, yea and members were written in Gods book,</hi> presuming (I suppose) that in this he had the express warranty of Scripture; the truth is that the Scripture, at least in expressness of terms, affirmeth neither the one, nor the other. For whereas, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.16. our English translation gives us, <hi>And in thy book all my members were written,</hi> it acknowledgeth by the different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that these words, <hi>my members,</hi> have no correspondent
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65873:236"/> in the original. However, we shall not question the truth of what Master <hi>Kendal</hi> hath thus far answered: But what it hath in truth, it wants in pertinency: for whilest he tells us of <hi>all mens names,</hi> and <hi>members written in Gods Book</hi> he slips his neck out of the collar of the question, which was not, whether all mens names and members were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Gods book, but whether <hi>all Parents</hi> have been <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or necessitated</hi> [whether by God, or otherwise] <hi>to the generation of all their children.</hi> His answer were proper enough to him that should deny, either the providence, or prescience of God: but it relateth not at all in opposition unto him, who onely denieth a <hi>determination, or necessitation of all Parents to the generation of all their children.</hi> He tutors and tells me (three or four lines after) that I should say, <hi>no Parents are determined to the generation of children.</hi> I confess that if I should say or write, as he would have me, it is like he might find somewhat to answer with some pertinency. In the mean time is not his Doctrine, that <hi>all Parents are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to the generation of all their children,</hi> confederate with that ignorant and profane saying of some rude per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that <hi>marrying and hanging go by destiny?</hi> I pass by his Unchristian taxing of all Parents (without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) both men and women, with <hi>lewd pleasure and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> in the propagation of all their children: and move on to the sequel of his Answer. It may be, though his first arrow was shot wide of the mark, the next may fall nearer to it.</p>
               <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> God hath made use of Bastards, those Bastards had not been made without the Providence of God.</hi> By the way, this is the first time that ever I heard of <hi>making Bastards:</hi> surely they are some new manufacture, lately invented in Master <hi>Kendals</hi> country of <hi>Scythia Anglicana.</hi> But letting acyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies pass, let us to the argument. First, Master <hi>Kendal</hi> argues the <hi>non-making of bastards without the providence of God,</hi> from the manner of their <hi>using by the providence of God: Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi> (saith he) <hi>how the Providence of God hath used them.</hi> Why Master <hi>Kendal how</hi> hath the <hi>Providence of God used</hi> all <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards,</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:65873:237"/> that from the peculiarity, or particularity of this <hi>use</hi> of them, the interposure of his providence, in, or about, the making of them, may be fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> demonstratively inferr'd or concluded? I do not believe that you can give us any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent account, that the Providence of God hath made any singular, or much remarkable use of all Bastards. And if there be any Bastard, one, or more, whom the Providence of God hath either not used, or not used in some signal or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable way, the special interposure of Providence, in or about the <hi>making</hi> them, cannot be concluded from any use which his providence makes of them. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, the using of creatures of one kind or other by the Providence of God, in what manner or kind soever they shall be used by it, is a superfluous and un-clerk-like kind of argument to prove their <hi>non-making</hi> without this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Because their very beings alone, simply considered, whether Providence should use them, or not use them, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prove that this providence was accessary to their making; inasmuch as nothing can act or move towards the generation or production of another thing, <hi>dormiente provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia, aut etiam non coagente seu cooperante,</hi> if providence were asleep, yea or did not act, or cooperate with it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Master <hi>Kendals</hi> thought, that <hi>bastards are not made without the Providence of God,</hi> is fully concurrent with my sense and notion, and no ways opposeth them, as he, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing it answer-wise, would make his Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. But I take knowledge of this in another place. Onely here I mention it, that it may appear that Master <hi>Kendal</hi> all this while answers nothing at all to the point in hand, but gives it a go-by in the shape or resemblance of an answer. But</p>
               <p>Fourthly, (&amp; lastly, for this) What may we muse to be the reason, why Master <hi>Kendal</hi> should fall upon a discourse of <hi>bastards,</hi> or insinuate to us the remarkable use of them by the Providence of God? I do not know, nor do I believe, that He is of the Order, or any of his. Yet certain I am that my words, which here he undertakes to canvase, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:65873:237"/> no occasion unto him, unless very remote, to turn out of his way into their quarters. For when I say that <hi>doubtless many persons both of men and women have been propagated and born into the world, whose Parents were not determined, or necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to their generation,</hi> my meaning chiefly was, and so my words give it out accordingly, that many persons both of men and women betake themselves to a married estate, and so come to be Parents of children, who were not <hi>determined [i.</hi> inevitably, or unavoidably designed or decreed by God hereunto] but left at the liberty and free choice of their own minds and wills, in this business. If Mr. <hi>K.</hi> had any thing either of Scripture, or good reason, to oppose against this, might he not have produced it without the help of his <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards;</hi> I mean [because I would not have him quarrel without cause, being so precipitately prone and propense hereunto] without making use of his unhandsome apostrophe to the mention and consideration of <hi>bastards?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which (in the sequel of his Answer) he means, by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label>
                  <hi>[What mean you by this, that doubtless many persons whose Parents are not]</hi> I understand not, nor himself (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) very well. Might not I aswell demand of him, what mean you by this, <hi>we had thought the Providence of God had not been made without the Providence of God?</hi> For these are words of his, drawn out from amongst their fellows in the same sentence, upon which their sense dependeth: so are those of mine, of which he asketh me the meaning. But what may we judge his meaning to be in this which follows (in an entire period) in his Answer? <hi>The Decrees of God</hi> (saith he) <hi>determine every one, necessitate none, so as to deprive them of their freedome,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>First, If his meaning be, that the <hi>Decrees of God,</hi> according to their true tenour and intent, alwaies take place, and are infrustrable by men, and consequently do <hi>determine</hi> those to whom they relate, which is decreed in them in relation to them, he neither opposeth me, nor any of my notions, or sayings, therein, but thus far occupies the place, <hi>corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, non respondentis.</hi> But I suppose this is not his meaning. Therefore</p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:65873:238"/>
               <p>Secondly, If his meaning be, that the <hi>Decrees of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine</hi> every person of mankind, to every action that is at any time done by them (and what else he should mean I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ariolate) I have several things to require of him for my satisfaction;</p>
               <p>First, Whether he judgeth that the <hi>Decrees of God</hi> do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>determine</hi> every person of mankind, to every non-action or to every forbearance of acting, which is found in them. This seemes to follow upon the other. For he that is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> to every thing he acteth, must needs be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from acting, whatsoever he acteth not. Because it he were not <hi>determined</hi> from acting that which he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, he should be at liberty to act it, and so should not be <hi>determined</hi> to his present actings: which is contrary to the other supposition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I would know of him, whether he finds, or plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in God, an equal number of (or at least, as many) De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, with the number both of all the actions, which every person of mankind performeth from the first to the last of his being, and likewise of all the actions which are refrained, or for born by every person of mankind, from first to last. If his answer be, that he finde this exact number of Decrees in God, I desire to know of him,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By what light, either of Scripture, or reason, he finds this finding. Because the Scripture no where report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any such vast number of Decrees in God, nor yet affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in generall (at least not in any expressness or plainness of words) that the number of Decrees in God is either exactly equal or superior to the number of all actions, that either have been, are, or ever shall be done, or that have been, are or ever shall be refrained, or not done, by all and every individuals of mankind, that have been, are, or ever shall be. I would understand from him,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, what he meaneth by <hi>every ones being determined by the Decrees of God.</hi> More particularly whether his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, that, this <hi>determination</hi> of them supposed, it is unpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for them or any of them to do any other thing, or any otherwise, then what, and as they do: or whether this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining</hi>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:65873:238"/> them, onely inclines or leads them towards, or near unto and as it were to the brink of, such and such particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of actions, but yet leaves them at liberty, either to do, or refrain them; because he immediately adds, that these Decrees <hi>necessitate none so as to deprive them of their freedom.</hi> If then he will own this latter sense of his word, <hi>Determined,</hi> I would learn of him,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Whether affirming that the <hi>Decrees of God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> every one in this sense onely, he doth not comport with his adversarie in that, wherein he would seem to oppose him? For when I deny that <hi>all Parents are determined to the generation of all their children,</hi> my meaning plainely and clearly is (and is sufficiently express'd as such) that all Parents are not so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> in this kind, but that some of them at least, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any <hi>determination</hi> whatsoever, precedaneous to their act of generating, might have refrained their acting in this kind. If his meaning stands with the former sense of the word, <hi>Determining,</hi> then before I can be satisfied, I must know of him,</p>
               <p>Sixthly, How the Decrees of God can (in this sense) <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine every one</hi> [to all their actions] and yet <hi>necessitate none, so as to deprive them of their freedom?</hi>

However, all this while we have gotten nothing from Master <hi>Kendal</hi> so much as in the likeness of an answer to the point in question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me. But</p>
               <p>It may be with the last stroke of his hammer he hits the nail on the head, drives it home, and proves demonstratively, that all <hi>Parents are determined to the generation</hi> or propagation <hi>of all their children.</hi> Hear we the demonstration with both
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65873:239"/> our ears, <hi>you</hi> (saith he) <hi>that seem to smile to think, how you have non-plust all contradiction in this parless instance, may upon second thoughts blush at your self for proposing it: and shall doubtless find that even the opposition of Gods providence, was by the same provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ordained,</hi> &amp;c. Not to be able to see that Master <hi>Kendal</hi> hath here learnedly confuted my assertion, concerning the non-determination of all parents to the generation of all their children, is no argument of a bad eye-sight. But</p>
               <p>First, From his confident prediction, that <hi>upon second <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> thoughts, I shall doubtless find even the opposition of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was by the same providence ordained,</hi> &amp;c. I may <hi>confidently</hi> conclude that he is a false prophet. For I have bin so far from <hi>finding,</hi> upon <hi>second,</hi> or third <hi>thoughts,</hi> that <hi>finding</hi> he speaks of, that I have onely found the falshood, yea and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mousness of it (as elsewhere I have accounted) Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing if he will acknowledge an acyrologie, or mistake, in the word <hi>ordained,</hi> &amp; that it slipt from his pen in stead of, <hi>ordered,</hi> I shall let this my indictment of blasphemy fall: but then the imputation of hunting counter, or giving a very wide <hi>go-by</hi> to the question in hand, will stick the closer and farter to him. For every <hi>opposition to Gods providence</hi> [in such a sense as <hi>Gods providence</hi> may be said to be <hi>opposed</hi>] is <hi>by the same providence</hi> ordered to <hi>the more illustrious magnifying of the glory of God in the shame of the Opposer,</hi> is my clear sense and notion all along my book. But in case the <hi>opposition</hi> here spoken of were <hi>ordained</hi> (as Master <hi>Kendal</hi> weeneth) by the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, it could have no tendencie, or pertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of contrivance, either for the <hi>illustrious magnifying of his</hi> own <hi>glory,</hi> or for the <hi>shame of the Opposer.</hi> To project or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the drawing of any man into an evil snare of sinning, stands not with the honour of any man wise, or foolish: but according as the projection is either more, or less, forcible or effectual, for ensnaring the person with the guilt of sin, so is his sin proportionably of greater, or less demerit: and if it could, or should, be supposed that any person could be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably brought to commit any sin by the projection or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivancie of another, the guilt of this sin would rest upon the Contriver, and not upon the Perpetrator. But it is a thing
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65873:240"/> frequent with Master <hi>Kendal</hi> reserving more worthy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thoughts for himself and his party, to ascribe unto God those that have little but weakness and dishonour in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas he chargeth me with the guilt of the <hi>appearance</hi> of the <hi>evil</hi> of <hi>smiling</hi> upon the occasion surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by him the truth is I am not conscious to my self of the evil of any such appearance. And for the occasion which he suggests of my <hi>seeming to smile,</hi> if I had known Master <hi>Kendal</hi> at the writing of my book, as now I do, it could not lightly have tempted me. For now I know so well, that I know also that it is in vain, whilest he lives and is himself, for any man to <hi>think</hi> of <hi>non-plussing all contradiction</hi> by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the cause of Truth, though with never so much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and power of conviction. But, alas! why should he be blamed for rising up, though never so early, to <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> the truth, when as he was <hi>determined</hi> and <hi>ordained</hi> beyond all possibility of resistance, or declining to do it? If I should have <hi>thought</hi> (which yet I remember not now to have been my <hi>thought</hi> then) that I had by what I had layd down in proof of my assertion <hi>non-plust all</hi> reasonable <hi>contradiction,</hi> I know no reason why I should <hi>blush</hi> at it: certain I am that Master <hi>Kendal</hi> hath given me no good reason thus to do. But <hi>non ea animorum, morumve felicitate nunc dierum vivitur,</hi> that any Assertor of truth should reasonably think by all the <hi>parless instance,</hi> or arguments, in the world, to silence or <hi>non-plus all contradiction.</hi> Errour is never like to want a friend in a black-coat whilest this world standeth.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> position to him, in the point in hand. For do not these <hi>hold themselves bound to work out their salvation with fear and trembling?</hi> Do not these hold, that God <hi>cannot forget his promise, so as to sorsake his Saints?</hi> Indeed they do not hold, that God can to any degree, <hi>forget his promise,</hi> which Master <hi>Kendal</hi> by his restrictive terms, <hi>so far,</hi> seemes to hold. Nor do they hold, that God <hi>can,</hi> or doth at any time, <hi>forsake his Saints,</hi> if by <hi>forsaking,</hi> he meanes an absolute and totall withdrawing of himself, or his grace and favour, from them; and understands the word, <hi>Saints,</hi> properly and formally, and not materially. They hold indeed, that God may and oft doth, <hi>forsake</hi> (in such a sense) the persons of those who have been <hi>Saints:</hi> but that he so <hi>forsaketh</hi> his <hi>Saints,</hi> as such, &amp; whilest such, they consent w<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Master <hi>Kendal</hi> in denying. However, they do not hold, that God <hi>forsakes</hi> (in any sense) <hi>his Saints</hi> (in any sense) contrary to any <hi>promise</hi> made by him, nor out of any <hi>forgetfulness</hi> of such a <hi>promise.</hi> Therefore if Master <hi>Kendal</hi> in saying, <hi>that God cannot so far forget his promise, as to forsake his Saints,</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:65873:241"/> supposeth any such <hi>promise</hi> made by him, by the intent and purport whereof he stands absolutely bound, actually and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventually to keep his <hi>Saints</hi> [such persons I mean, who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent are <hi>Saints</hi>] from apostatizing (which he must suppose, unless he intends no opposition to his adversaries) it seemes he expects <hi>Salmacida spolia sine sanguine &amp; sudore,</hi> a conquest without a battel, and a victory without a blow given. But this is the usual method of Master <hi>Kendals</hi> warfare: to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose liberally, to affirm confidently, and to argue imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, and then to insult masculinely, and to triumph vain-gloriously. For his adversaries absolutely deny that there is any such <hi>promise</hi> to be found in the Scriptures, of such an import, as that mentioned. And because this their denial is hard of eviction by proof or argument, therefore Master <hi>Kendal</hi> prudently confutes it, not by a bare, or meer, but by a magisterial supposition of the contrary. But what he meanes by his two explicatorie clauses, <hi>as to our selves,</hi> and, <hi>in respect of God,</hi> I am to seek; but I neither know how, nor where. If his meaning be, that <hi>he and his hold themselves bound to work out their salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> by an argument or consideration drawn from <hi>themselves,</hi> and not from <hi>God,</hi> they argue quite contrarie to the Holy Ghost; who admonisheth the <hi>Philippians</hi> (and in them, Master <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> and his partie) to <hi>work out their salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> by an argument drawn from God, and not from themselves, <hi>work out your own salvation</hi> (saith he) <hi>with fear and trembling: For it is God that worketh</hi> [or rather, that is working] <hi>in you both to will and to do, of his good pleasure,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. So far is he from exhorting them to <hi>work,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>confidently in respect of God.</hi> But Master <hi>Kendals</hi> Logick (it seemes) is contrarie to the Logick of the Holy Ghost: and what this argueth, according to his own principles, I shall not need to tell him, for he hath told me and all the world (as we heard formerly.)<note n="(a)" place="margin">See c. <hi>10.</hi> Sect. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> And how he and his, go to <hi>work</hi> not onely the same thing, but at the same time also, both with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trembling,</hi> and yet with <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> too, (at least upon his supposall, that there is an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition between <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trembling</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:65873:241"/> on the other) I believe that plowing with Master <hi>Kendals</hi> heifer it self would not resolve me, or help me to understand the riddle. Besides, if their hearts serve them to work out their salvation <hi>with confidence in respect of God,</hi> what need they, or how can they, <hi>work it out with fear and trembling, in respect of themselves?</hi> or what doth the one <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> vary, or import differing, from the other? For whatever strength they have <hi>to work,</hi> they have it from God, and not from themselves: and when God at any time giveth such strength unto them, it is as much their own, as any thing else which they have. And if they be as certained that God will give them strength, not onely sufficient to <hi>work out their salvation,</hi> but that which certainly shall be efficient also of this work, how can they (in any tolerable construction) be said to <hi>work it out with fear and trembling, in respect of themselves,</hi> considering that such their <hi>certainty</hi> is their own (being given unto them by God) and withall, is the ground of their <hi>confidence</hi> in <hi>working?</hi> Besides, it would be worth the while for Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> to declare plainly and distinctly unto us, what it is in themselves, in <hi>respect</hi> of which they <hi>hold themselves bound to work out their salvation with fear and trembling?</hi> If he shall say, it is the consciousness or sense of their own weakness, or want of strength to work; I would ask him, first, whether they do <hi>work,</hi> or intend to <hi>work out their salvation,</hi> by this weakness, or want of strength? If not (for I suppose his answer will be negative) then what reason have they to <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>tremble,</hi> that these will not hold out, or enable them to <hi>work out their salvation,</hi> especially when they certainly know, that they have, or shall have, strength suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hereunto otherways? When a labouring man goes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to threshing, or ditching, he is conscious that his little finger is weak, and wants strength, to perform either of these works: but doth he therefore go about his work with <hi>fear and trembling in respect</hi> of his little finger, or the little strength which he finds here, when as he knowes that he hath a sufficiencie of strength in his arm to carry it thorow? If a man having two horses, the one foundered and lame &amp; no ways fit for travel, the other, sound of wind and limb,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:65873:242"/> and every ways well qualified for the road, hath occasion to take a journey of 40 or 50 miles, doth he ride on the way upon his sound and well qualified horse with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> in respect of his other horse that is lame at home? When Master <hi>Kendal</hi> undertook the Answering of <hi>Redemption Redeemed,</hi> he was conscious to himself that he had not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or wit enough in all the hair upon his head, to make good his undertaking with credit: yet being confident of his head, and of a super-sufficiencie of wit and learning here for the exploit, he did not go about it, or carry it on, with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trembling,</hi> or with any doubtfulness of success, in respect of the illiterateness or witlessness of his hair? In like manner, if he and his compeeres, know that they have, or shall have, such a measure of strength from God for the <hi>working out their salvation,</hi> which shall not onely ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to this work, not onely ingage them to set about this work, but which shall further so influence them, that they can neither will nor chuse but to <hi>work out their salvation</hi> by it, have they any reason or ground to <hi>work</hi> in this case <hi>with fear and trembling in respect of themselves,</hi> or their own weakness? Therefore certainly Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> distinction, of their holding themselves bound to work out their salvation with fear and trembling, <hi>in respect of themselves,</hi> yet confidently, <hi>in respect of God,</hi> is both Anti-scriptural, anti-rational, and (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) very ridiculous and absurd.</p>

O do I, or any other of those who make Master <hi>Kendal</hi> heterodox in these controversies, deny aswel the <hi>subsequent,</hi> as <hi>antecedent</hi> intentions of God, to be <hi>eternal?</hi> Or do we term those <hi>subsequent,</hi> which we call such, because they are conceived, or taken up by God, <hi>after</hi> the other? or do we any where make <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>posterius,</hi> in eternity? Therefore to argue against the Distinction understood in any such sense, which drawes along with it any of these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions or the like, is to beat the air instead of the bush where the bird sits; and to leave his Adversaries undistur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the possession of their sense and notion, which put his to rebuke. Nay he could not but know, that my sense in the Distinction, was quite another thing then, yea quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, which he so belabours with his pen. For are not my express words (concerning the same) these? This, with <hi>the forementioned Authors</hi> [Chrysostome, and Damascene] <hi>I call his consequent will, or Intention. The former of these is not called his antecedent will or intention, either because it precedes the other in time, or in eternity, or in worth or dignity, or the like: no precedency in any of these kinds, hath place amongst the Decrees, wills, or Intentions of God, which are all equally eternal, equally honourable and worthy of him. But the reason of this denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is, because it is so ordered, and cometh to pass by Divine dispensation, that grace and means for the obtaining of salvation, are alwayes in the first place vouchsafed unto men, before either salvation be actually conferr'd upon any man that believeth; or any thing penal (I mean, spiritually penal) or any wayes tending, either to obduration, or condemnation, be inflicted upon unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and much more before actual destruction is brought upon them.</hi> So that the latter of the said two wills <hi>or intentions in God, is therefore termed</hi> Consequent, <hi>because he never acteth in order to, or with any tendency towards, the condemnation or destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of men, but consequently to, and after such actings of his,

No, I have no temptation upon me to do it: and my sense is, that the Evangelist useth the word <hi>world</hi> in a very proper, at least familiar and well known signification. But I think it very fit to correct you (Master <hi>Kendal</hi>) for making the Evangelist to speak <hi>barbarously</hi> and uncouthly, when he speaketh plainly, and to the ordinary capacities of men. Thirdly, He tells me, that <hi>the Evangelist
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65873:245"/> wrote, as the Spirit directed</hi> him, as if I had denied, or doubted of this, in my consideration. Fourthly, He tells me that <hi>it may be he was directed to use the word</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] here, <hi>that such as I might be mistaken in it.</hi> Whereas the Holy Ghost tells me and others a far better and truer story by this Evangelist, <hi>viz.</hi> that the things which he had written, <hi>were written that we might not mistake, but believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, &amp; that believing we might have life thorow his name,</hi> Joh. 20.31. Fifthly, (and lastly) to make his answer apposite and close to the argument before him, he tells me; <hi>If the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures use this word, world, for the Elect, we are not sollicitous whether they speak according to the mode of other Authors, or no.</hi> Upon Master <hi>Kendals</hi> supposition, I could be as free with Master <hi>Kendals</hi> freedom, as himself.

               <p>
                  <q>Nor doth he answer much more pertinently to my third consideration, levied upon the former account. Herein I argue to this effect. If by the world (in the Scripture in hand) be meant the Elect, in the sense of the Assertors of this signification, then it will follow that God out of his great love gave Christ unto those who stood in no need of him, at least either to preserve them from perishing, or to invest them with a right or title to eternal life; which yet
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65873:245"/> are here laid down as the two onely, or at least the two main ends of that great gift. For if exemption from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, or salvation, be absolutely, and without all consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, awarded or decreed by God unto men, before, or from eternity, they have a full right or title unto the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and enjoyment of it by vertue of this award, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, without the intervening of any thing else whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</q> For what better right or title can there be, then a Decree of Heaven? In stead of answering directly to the notion of this argument opposing his sense of the word, <hi>World,</hi> he steps aside to reprove me for a fault, which he would gladly find in my expression of my self in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, if it were there. <hi>This your grave consideration</hi> (saith he) <hi>is somewhat lightly expressed, that God out of his great love gave Christ to those who had no need of him, if by the world be meant the Elect,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It's neither safely nor soberly done to play</hi> in sacris. If I had offended in some <hi>lightness of expression</hi> (an offence not committed by me here, as far as yet I know, though possibly elsewhere, which I doubt not but my God will graciously cover, though Master <hi>Kendal</hi> will not) yet Master <hi>Kendal</hi> was in no good capacity to reprove me in words, who hath so largely justified me by deeds: I mean by super-abounding in offences of the same kind. If fall his <hi>light expressions</hi> were taken out of his two books, they would weigh ten ounces <hi>lighter</hi> at the least. But why is my consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration (which you, jearing wise, call <hi>grave) somewhat light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed?</hi> Or how, or why, do I <hi>play in sacris?</hi> Do I say that <hi>God out of his great love gave Christ to those that stood in no need of him?</hi> No, Master <hi>Kendal,</hi> I onely say, that you, and your opinion about the sense of the word, <hi>World,</hi> say it. But it is frequent with you, and men of your notions (as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served elsewhere) to charge those, that shall oppose your fond Tenents and Doctrines, and detect the vanity of them, with want of reverence to God and the Scriptures. Afterwards, girding up the loines of his pen to make an answer, to the said consideration, he tells me, that <hi>the Elect had need of Christ, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as others, notwithstanding the eternal Decree that they should not perish, but have everlasting life. Their title is not barely by
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65873:246"/> Gods Decree, but by Gods decree to preserve them from perishing, and to invest them with a title to eternall life, through his Sons death.</hi> This <hi>was included in the decree,</hi> &amp;c. (with much more to the same confused tune.)</p>
               <p>First, Where he tells me, <hi>their title is not barely by Gods Decree, but by Gods Decree to preserve them,</hi> &amp;c. Doth he not plainly dissemble and decline the purport and argument of that Consideration? For when this demandeth (as himself transcribeth) <hi>what better right or title can there be [to the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of anything,</hi> these words he leaveth out] <hi>then a Decree of Heaven,</hi> doth or can he imagine that it meaneth a <hi>bare De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> (in his sense) i. a <hi>Decree</hi> without an object, or without te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or import? Or (indeed) of any other tenor or import, then this, to <hi>preserve them from perishing,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore his answer here keeps aloof off from the argument before him, as if it were afraid of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas he adds, <hi>This [Christs death] was included in the Decree as the onely means whereby God would convey his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing unto them,</hi> he presently contradicts himself in both parts of this assertion. First, whereas he here saith, that <hi>the death of Christ was included in the Decree,</hi> soon after he saith, that <hi>God absolutely and without consideration ordained salvation to his Elect.</hi> Was the death of <hi>Christ included in the decree,</hi> and yet the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree absolute and without consideration? Capiat qui potis est capere.</hi> If the <hi>death of Christ was included in the Decree,</hi> doubtless it was here <hi>included,</hi> upon, or under, some <hi>consideration</hi> or other: or was it inserted or placed here in vain? Though I look upon Master <hi>Kendal</hi> as one of the most daring men under Heaven with his pen, and one that neither regards credit, nor consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when they stand in his way to hinder him from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the raw conceptions of his braine; Yet I suppose, that such a saying as this, the <hi>Death of Christ was included in Gods Decree to no purpose,</hi> or in vain, is a morsel that he will not readily swallow. Therefore certainly, if Christs death was included in Gods Decree to save his Elect, this Decree was not absolute, and without consideration. Again second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas in the former passage he saith, that <hi>Christs death was included in the Decree</hi> (we speak of) <hi>as the onely means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:65873:246"/> God would convey his blessing unto them,</hi> in the very next, as if he had wanted an adversary to contend with, he quarrels with himself, in saying; <hi>This Decree of their Salvation was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in respect of any motive on the Elects part, not without all means [</hi>the former part of this saying is too easie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, the latter, too hard: for who can understand what means there should be of <hi>Gods Decrees?] There was required both Christs death for the Elect, and the Elects Faith in Christs death.</hi> If so, then <hi>Christs death was not included in the Decree, as the onely means whereby,</hi> &amp;c. Not long after, he redoubles the contradiction, in saying: <hi>The Decree of Heaven gives no title to Heaven, but according to the tenour of the Decree</hi> [this is the express sense of his adversary, no answer to any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by him] <hi>and this includes these great means, Christs death, and the Elects Faith.</hi> But though he be thus confused in his answer, and inconsistent with himself, though he hath said nothing to the <hi>consideration</hi> before him, but what he hath unsaid again, reeling to and fro, and staggering this way and that, like a drunken man; yet after his wonted mode he claps his wings, and crowes like a cock of the game (though it be over his own dunghil) at his coming off. <hi>And thus</hi> (saith he) <hi>your grave consideration weighs just nothing: and is a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable objection against the signification which we put upon the word World, in the text in hand.</hi> Bravely spoken (Mr. <hi>K.</hi>) however, and souldier-like: but who is the <hi>Bragga-dochio</hi> now? There is a sense (I confess) wherein the <hi>objection</hi> you speak of may (in reference to your self) be <hi>inconsiderable</hi> it may be, yea (it seems) it is such, that your considering faculties cannot comprehend it. But by your tumbling and tossing up and down in your answer, not finding where to set the sole of your foot safely, I perceive your do not understand the sense of those of your own party, who best understand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in these controversies. For these do not include, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ, or Christs death, or Faith, in the <hi>Decree of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> but form another <hi>Decree</hi> in God, <hi>de dandis mediis,</hi> in which they include them. And though this be somewhat more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and much more distinct, then Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> jumbling De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; yet is it not of any good accord, either with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65873:247"/> or principles of sound reason. Not with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; because first, they do not hold forth or place any such Decr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e in God, wherein such and such persons by Name and personally considered, are or should be in time perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily elected unto salvation. Nor secondly, do they hold forth or mention any decree of Election in God, precedane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in consideration unto <hi>Christ,</hi> but onely such, which is (as it were) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ounded and built upon him, and for the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof in the mind of God, he is represented as mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the occasion and opportunity. <hi>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual blessings in heavenly things, in Christ: According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundations of the world,</hi> &amp;c. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, cap. 3.11. <hi>According to the eternal purpose, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in Christ Jesus our Lord [i.</hi> thorow, or by means of him; as one, without whom, or without the contemplation or consideration of whom, no such purpose was ever like to have been conceived or taken up by him.]</p>
               <p>Nor doth the love of God to the world, mentioned (<hi>John</hi> 3.16. the text now in hand) as having occasioned, by way of motive, and precedent-wise, the gift of <hi>Christ</hi> unto it, any wayes contradict the notion, or Doctrine, which presenteth <hi>Christ,</hi> as exhibiting unto God an opportunity for, or induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto, his <hi>purpose</hi> or <hi>Decree of Election.</hi> For God might have apprehended an opportunity, in, or by <hi>Christ,</hi> for such a <hi>purpose</hi> or <hi>Decree,</hi> and yet not have actually conceived or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up this purpose, and consequently, not have given <hi>Christ</hi> for the salvation of the world, in case his love had not been exceeding great to the world. So that this blessed affection in God to mankind, or to the world, contributed also with an open hand toward his sending, or giving, his onely begotten Son for the salvation of it. A man may have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as either by means of his place, his interest in great men, or the like, to pleasure a man, one, or more, in matters of good concernment to them: Yet unless he bears some good respects of love and favour to these men, he will not make use of the opportunity in hand for such their accommodation or preferment. Or in case he should bear great good will
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65873:247"/> unto them, and desire their preferment, yet, supposing him to be a man of wisdom, conscience and honour, he would not prefer them, unless he had a creditable and fair opportunity inducing him hereunto. In like manner, though the love of God to the world had been never so great, and his heart never so much set upon the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and salvation of it, yet unless he had had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of means every wayes answerable to the infiniteness of his wisdom, and justice, he would not have lift up his heart, or put forth his hand to the doing of it.</p>
               <p>Nor secondly, is that Decree of Election, with that other, <hi>de dandis mediis</hi> (made subordinate to it) against which at present we argue, consonant with reason. For, it sounds no good accord either with the infinite justice or wisdom of God peremptorily, and beyond all possibility of reversal, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or to decree to elect, to salvation (the greatest blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of which the creature is capable) any person of mankind, one or more, how unworthily or wickedly soever they shall live and die in this present world. To reply here and say, but as God peremptorily electeth, or decreeth to elect men unto salvation, so he likewise electeth, or decreeth to elect, them unto Repentance, Faith, Holiness, &amp;c. or (which is in effect the same) he decreeth by his power to bring them unto Repentance, Faith, &amp;c. Such a reply (I say) as this, if it doth any thing at all, it contradicts that very notion of the Decree of Election in God, which it is brought to countenance and salve. For if God intendeth or decreeth, to bring those to Repentance, Faith, Holiness, &amp;c. whom he Electeth, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth to Elect, unto salvation, he must be notioned or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to decree this concerning them, either before, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or in the same point, or moment, with the other Decree (I mean that concerning their salvation.) If he be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to decree their bringing to Repentance, &amp;c. after he hath passed his Decree for their salvation, this doth not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Decree against the burthen of the objection. For if he decreeth their salvation, before he hath decreed any thing concerning their repentance, &amp;c. then it still followes that he hath peremptorily decreed to save them, how unworthily
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65873:248"/> or wickedly so ever they shall live; in as much as there is no caveat or caution at all inserted, or put into the decree of their salvation, but this is absolutely and peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed against all possible inconveniences, as of sin, wickedness, impenitencie, or of whatsoever: otherwise it is not absolute, or peremptorie. And that Decree concerning their bringing to repentance, which comes after, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as the Greek proverb hath it) cannot be construed but as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging an errour or defect in the other decree, it self being made to supply that which was wanting there. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that no such Decree, which is defective, and needeth another decree to supply that which was wanting in it, to make it regular, or worthy, is, or can be, any decree of God. Besides, when any purpose, or Decree, which is in the frame, tenour, or matter of it, justifiable, and worthy, the execution hereof according to this tenour, and without the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, mediation, or requirement of any forraign or a new cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, is justifiable also. If it be warrantable, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to intend and resolve to reward my servant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any consideration of his diligence and faithfulness in my service, or (which is the same) whether he shall be diligent and faithfull in my service, or no, certainly I may as warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and lawfully reward him, though he proves neither dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent nor faithful therein unto me. For what is straight in the intention, cannot be crooked in the execution, if the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be conform to the intention. So then if any such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree be worthy the infinite holiness, wisdom, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, wherein, or whereby he shall be supposed, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily and absolutely, and without any consideration of their Faith, holiness of life, &amp;c. to have decreed such and such men (as <hi>viz.</hi> those commonly termed his Elect) unto salvation, what hinders but that he might execute this his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree according to the tenour of it, and so actually confer sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon these men, without requiring of them either Faith, or holiness, in order hereunto, in as much as neither of these were considered or once minded in the said Decree? And if Salvation be such a reward which is not meet to be given unto men, without consideration of, and upon their
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:65873:248"/> Faith, and obedience; neither is such a Decree meet to be attributed unto God, wherein he is supposed to have decreed this reward unto men, without respect or consideration of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>If it be said that the Decree of God concerning the bringing of his Elect unto repentance, precedes his Decree concerning their Election to Salvation; then is not this Decree concerning their Salvation absolute or irrespective, but upon consideration, or foresight of their repentance. For to what purpose should God premise a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for bringing to repentance those, whom now he decreeth to save, unless he judgeth it meet not to Decree the Salvation of any, but of those onely, who he knows will repent, live holily, &amp;c. and that in this very respect or consideration? For if God should have no respect to the future repentance, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of those whom he decreeth to save, in this his Decree concerning them, why should he insure these [their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and holiness] by an antecedent Decree? There is the same consideration of the third and last member of the late distribution, in case that be accepted and insisted on; although it be hardly rational to imagine or suppose two different and distinct Decrees to be conceived in one and the same point or instant of time, in the mind of the same Decreer. For though it be most regular and rational to conceive all Gods Decrees to be, or to have been, eternal, or from eternity, yet is it not rational to conceive them to have been so many different or distinct Decrees in him from eternity, no more then it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to conceive him to have been plurified or distinct from himself in his essence, or being. For though it be truly said that every Decree of God is really God himself; and that all the Decrees attributable unto him, are different and distinct one from another; yet is it not true to say that this variety of Decrees which are attributable unto him, argueth any plurality, or variety in one kind or other, in his being. The reason is, because various and different Decrees are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed unto God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, because he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, or revealed in his word, or otherwise, that such and such things shall be acted and done by him, or else shall be
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65873:249"/> permitted by him to be acted and done by others, after such a manner, or upon such terms, as if they had been respectively decreed by him. And according to the different natures, or imports, of the things, which he hath revealed shall be either effected, or permitted by him, so are the Decrees which are attributed unto him, numbred and distinguished. So that a formall or proper plurality of Decrees in God, is not the ground or reason, why various and different Decrees are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto him; but a discovery made by himself that such and such things, of a different nature and consideration, shall be so effected, or permitted by him, as if they had been decreed by him, that is, certainly, constantly, and against all interveniency or opposition. Now then Decrees not being formally or properly (as hath been said) attributable unto God, but onely in a way of resemblance to somewhat rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Decrees of men, because it is repugnant both to reason and truth that two different and distinct Decrees should be at one and the same instant of time conceived or form'd in the mind of a man, therefore we judge it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to reason to ascribe such a thing unto God; although if such an ascription shall be judged reasonable, it would no wayes dis-accommodate the service of that cause, which we have in hand, as hath been already declared.</p>
               <p>If it be here demanded (though the demand be eccentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the cause in hand) but if that be the ground of attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Decrees unto God, which hath been mentioned and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted for such, how, or upon what account may it be said that every, or any Decree of God is God himself? I answer, the ground of such an expression or saying as this, is the most single, simple, and undivided essence or nature of God. By reason hereof, whatsoever we judge meet to place in God, we are constrained to judge and term it God himself: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause otherwise we cannot salve the infinite simplicity of his essence. And hence it passeth with the generality of the best and most Orthodox writers, for sound Divinity, that <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid in Deo est, est Deus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be yet further replied, and demanded; But if I judge
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65873:249"/> it meet to place Decrees in God, or in the Divine essence it self, why do I not make this [the Divine nature, or God himself] the ground of attributing Decrees unto him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then such a revelation made by him, as that pleaded for to this point? I answer, The Divine nature or essence, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and in it self considered, can be no ground or reason un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Creature of attributing any thing in one kind or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unto God, but onely those discoveries or revelations, which it hath made of it self, in one kind or other, unto him. Without these it would be impossible for men either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or speak, any thing of God, at least regularly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandingly, and according to truth. For how can a man form a right notion or conception within him (unless casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and by accident, if so) of any thing, whereof he hath no knowledge, or apprehension? Or how can he come to the knowledge of any thing, unless it be some wayes or other discovered or made known to him? The Divine nature or essence may much more properly be termed the ground or reason of those revelations or discoveries, which God hath made of himself unto men, then of their attributing any thing, though never so regularly and truly, unto him. For the reason why God hath made such discoveries of himself unto the world, is, because his nature, or being is such, which both answereth these discoveries, and likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth him to make them unto his Creature. But this by the way.</p>
               <p>By the tenour and process of this whole discourse it sufficiently appeareth that Master <hi>Kendals</hi> absolute and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respective Decree of Election it self cannot stand; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be much more plausibly defensible then its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; I mean an absolute Decree of Reprobation. And if it be above the tolerable account of the best of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the present controversies, and such which are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest to take the best tincture or colour of truth, how will he acquit himself and come off, when he shall come to plead the cause of his <hi>Monstra horrenda,</hi> his black and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Decree of Reprobation, which will endure nothing
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65873:250"/> worthy a righteous God, or reasonable man, to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it? his direfull notion of <hi>Sancta simulatio in Deo,</hi> When his words to sinners are smoother then oyl, and yet (according to this notion) an irreconcileable war in his hearr against them; when he swears by his own life that he desires not the death of the wicked, and yet out of his meer will and pleasure, and without all regret had doomed them to this death from eternity, with several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a like hideous and portentuous import.</p>

               <p>A few lines after, ascribing new <hi>transient Acts</hi> unto God (a notion wherein, it seems, he takes much content, feeding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and anon upon it) yet saith, that <hi>they are onely in the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;</hi> and a little after: <hi>surely his transient operations are not the same with his essence, but with the essences rather of things produced by him.</hi> But first, his very notion of ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing <hi>transient acts</hi> unto God, being no wayes necessitated, nor so much as occasioned by the Scriptures hereunto, no nor yet by any sound principle in reason, Hath no very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant or friendly aspect upon the glory of God, or infinite Perfection of his Being. For it implying neither imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nor contradiction, but perfection in abundance, and so a fair possibility to an infinite wisdom and power, that God by onely one Creative immanent Act should give being unto all things respectively, which he judged necessary or convenient to be, and this at such times and seasons as he judged most convenient for them to receive their being (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively) to multiply acts in God, whether under the name of <hi>immanent,</hi> or <hi>transient,</hi> reflects disparagement upon him, and occasioneth men to conceive of him <hi>creature-wise,</hi> and as if he had a like necessity lying upon him to multiply actings for the effecting of a plurality of ends, or effects, as men, and other creatures have. Whereas most certain and evident it is, that it proceedes from weakness and imperfection in the creature (I mean such a weakness and imperfection, which are essential to a creature, as such, and which distinguisheth a created Being, from that which is increated) that it is not able by one and the same act to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish and effect all things, which concern it at any time, and in all cases, to effect and bring to pass: For who, or what creature, would act often in order to the obtaining of that, which he is in a capacity of obtaining by one Act one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and this no more troublesome or inconvenient in one
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:65873:252"/> kind or other unto it, then every one of those multiplied acts must needs be supposed to be? Therefore he that imposeth a necessity upon God of multiplying Acts for a multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of effects, or production of what numbers of Beings soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and at what time or times soever he pleaseth, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantleth him of the Infinity of his Divine Perfection, and changeth the glory of his power into the similitude of a creatures weakness. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas he placeth those <hi>transient acts,</hi> which he attributeth unto God, <hi>onely in the Patient,</hi> i. in the created Beings respectively produced by these imaginary Acts in God [or rather indeed by that one <hi>Great Creative Act</hi> we speak of] doth he not take and give away the glory, the incommunicable glory of God, unto <hi>corruptible men, unto birds and four-footed beasts, and creeping things?</hi> For what doth he, at least what can he reasonably mean by these <hi>transient acts</hi> of God, but the exercise, or putting forth of his infinite power, in order to the producing of such or such things, or creature-beings? So then if these excercises be in the creatures produced, and in these <hi>onely,</hi> are they not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to them, and this so, that they cannot properly or formally be attributed unto God? For nothing that is <hi>onely</hi> in the creature, or (indeed) at all in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is properly or formally attributable unto God. For nothing can be in the creature, especially being the <hi>essence</hi> of it, or any thing belonging, either to the essence, or existence of it, but onely that which is finite: and that which is finite cannot, at least not properly or formally, be attributed unto God. Therefore upon this account the <hi>transient Acts</hi> Master <hi>Kendal</hi> speaks of, cannot be attributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto him. If he pleadeth, that they may be ascribed or attributed to him, as the Efficient or productive cause of them, though not as the subject; I answer, If they may be ascribed unto him, as the efficient cause of them, then as oft as he exerteth them, or any of them, he must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>aliquid agere,</hi> or <hi>efficere de novo,</hi> i. to put forth some vertue or power, which he did not put forth before.
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:65873:252"/> If so, how can poor Master <hi>Kendal</hi> pay his debts, I mean, <hi>salve</hi> the immutability of God, which he undertaketh to do? If by his <hi>transient Acts,</hi> he means nothing but Gods giving being unto things, which had no being before, and this without an exertion or putting forth of any vertue or power, which he had not put forth before, even from the beginning, then the man is more contradictious then his opinion, and his <hi>transient Acts</hi> signifie nothing but what my <hi>one great Creative Act</hi> imports; against which notwithstanding he thinks that he hath done God service to magnifie himself. However, he hath so encumbred and intangled himself with his notion of <hi>transient Acts</hi> in God, that it is unpossible for him to <hi>salve all</hi> (as he saith) I mean, the credit of his notion, the propriety of his terms, and the glory of the unchangeableness of God. I have some little saying further to Mr. <hi>Ks. transient Acts</hi> upon another account, elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Nor are these demands of his (levied not long after his dispatch with his <hi>transient Acts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Se.</note> now mentioned) alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether free from blasphemous insinuations against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perfection of God, <hi>Did God work Faith in my heart by the same Act he made the elements? Did that act produce my Faith, when yet Adam neither had, nor was in that state of his innocencie capable of Faith in a Redeemer?</hi> What compassion on him, or his cause, these last words should have, <hi>When yet Adam neither had, nor was,</hi> &amp;c. Passeth all my understanding. And for these two demands (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted between the two now mentioned, as if they were of the same, or like consideration with them) they are so eccentricall and impertinent to the business in hand, and so unequally yoked with their fellows (as hath been elsewhere observed) that their value may be summed up in a cypher; <hi>Did he plant Faith</hi> (saith he) <hi>when he made plants? Did he make me to differ from many others, and from my self, by creating of the world?</hi> I excuse Master <hi>Kendal</hi> from any insinuative or consequential bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemie against God in these demands: but I cannot be
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65873:253"/> his compurgator from blasphemous intentions in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his neighbour, who neither did, nor thought him the least harme.

                  </gap>he consequences of my Doctrine, whereas indeed and in truth, this hath no communion with them. For the other two, I acknowledge my self no wayes, at least not directly injured or disparaged by them: but they are of an ill reflexion upon God, and assailant of his infinite, ineffable, and unconceiveable Perfection. For do they not insinuate, that God is subject to the Lawes and terms of humane weakness and imperfection? And that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men cannot exert any such act, whereby different effects should be produced, especially in different ages, therefore neither can the power of God extend to such a thing? Because that Master <hi>Kendals</hi> arm is too short to reach from East to West, and cannot at the same time lift it self to act, or work in both places, must therefore the arm of God be reduced to the same scantling of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and must he be confined unto, and imprisoned in the narrow sphere of Master <hi>Kendals</hi> activity? And if God be as able at once to stretch forth his arm over all generations and ages between the creation of the world, and the final dissolution of it, as he is to stretch it in a moment from East to West, from Earth to Heaven; why should he not be as able by one and the same lifting up of it, to operate and give being unto things in the first and last age, yea in the first and last hour of the world, as he is at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to work and act like himself, both in the East and West, in the Heavens and in the Earth? Therefore as <hi>Christ</hi> said unto the <hi>Sadduces, Do ye not therefore erre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God?</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mar. 12.24</note> so may it truly be said to Master <hi>Kendal,</hi> that his Theologie in the business in hand, is Erroneous and Deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie to the endless Perfection of God, upon the clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the same ignorance.

If Master <hi>Kendal</hi> should invite me to his house, and yet were resolv'd, that whatever came of it, I should never come there, if his base deportment in this kind should come to my knowledge, could I judge any otherwise of him, then as a man of deplorable and forlorn principles?

Yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and anon he is harping upon the doleful string of this blasphemy. Not long before, (<hi>viz.</hi> pag. 127. of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part) he had hardned his pen to write thus unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God, and withall, to jear at him that should reprove him for it. <hi>Here might be, though no purpose of exclusion of any, yet a purpose of hindring them from coming, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the invitation. What think you of Gods injunction to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh to let Israel go? Had he not said to Moses before, that he would harden Pharaohs heart that he should not let Israel go? I pray call a court, and bring the King of Heaven to an account for this, that he commanded Pharaoh to let his people go, and yet harboured a precedent intention to harden his heart that he should not let them go.</hi> The King of Heaven will in due time call a court himself, and bring all those to an account, who have either spoken, or written, dishonourably of him; and who change the riches of the glory of his Grace and goodness, into the wretchedest and vilest strains of demeanour, that are to be found in the most abhorred of men, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him thus unto his creature: and more especially those, who pretending to be Masters in his <hi>Israel,</hi> misuse him with his own words and sayings, and would bear the world in hand that he hath spoken such things of himself, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and in truth dismantle his Godhead, and bereave him of all or most of those transcendent perfections, those majestick Attributes, which should and do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

And I fear that Master <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> will be arraigned at this Court amongst Transgressours in this kind. Or is the ear of a man tenderly jealous for the Honour of his God, able to hear the sound of such words concerning him, as these; that he may invite his poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to a Feast, and this over and over with much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (as the Parable plainly enough informeth us) and yet <hi>have a purpose of hindring them from coming, such his invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion notwithstanding?</hi> Would not a man, that should imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and be like Master <hi>Kendals</hi> God in such a strain of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour as this, be the just hatred of God, Angels, and men? Or when our Saviour imposed this injunction upon men, <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> did he teach them hypocrisie, or to keep war in their hearts against such men, to whom their words are as smooth as oyl? Or doth the sheild that Master <hi>Kendal</hi> layes hold on to defend his most horrid saying concerning God, afford him any shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or protection? Doth an injunction or charge, especially for the doing of that, which is sorely repugnant to the mind and inclination of him that is charged (as Gods injunction unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let <hi>Israel</hi> go, was) run parallel with an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to a feast? Where was the Gentlemans <hi>Ingeniolum,</hi> when he could match his harp no better then with an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? Or is it the same thing for Master <hi>Kendal</hi> to have the Rectory of <hi>Excester</hi> Colledge, or of the Deantie of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> proffered unto him, and to be injoyned the publick recantation of his two blasphemous books under the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being fed with bread and water in a close prison all his dayes? I believe the latter would not correspond in his judgement, much less in his affections, with the former. But I perceive by his arguing for the case as yet depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he understands not those words of God to <hi>Moses,</hi> wherein he saith that he would <hi>harden Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs heart that he should not let Israel go.</hi> For he affirms, that notwithstanding his injunction or command to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let <hi>Israel</hi> go, yet <hi>he harboured a precedent intention to harden his
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65873:256"/> heart that he should not let them go.</hi> This he saith, presuming (it seems) upon the good will of his Reader, to relieve him in his straits for want of proofs, with his credulity. That God neither intended the hardning of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, nor intends the hardning of any man, with his primary or ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Intentions, I have argued and proved at large in my exposition of the ninth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> p. 218, 219, 220, &amp;c. Therefore certainly whoever Mr. <hi>K.</hi> did intend to convince, or satisfie, in saying that <hi>God harboured a precedent intention to harden Pharaohs heart that he should not let Israel go,</hi> it was no part or piece of his intent, either to convince or satisfie his Adversary; unless (haply) he conceit his <hi>Ipse dixit</hi> to be a charm or spell of that potency, that it is able to loose the bands of five or six demonstrations from off the judgment of his adversary, and to lead him hoodwinkt in captivity to it self. Or if by a <hi>precedent intention</hi> in God to harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart that he should not let <hi>Israel</hi> go, he intends to abuse the simplicity of his Reader, hoping that by a <hi>precedent intention,</hi> he will only understand an intent in God to harden <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> before he injoyned him to let <hi>Israel</hi> go, this I confess is like the man, who all along calculates the tenors both of his noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and expression<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And this, to those whose judgments already stand by his in the present controversies, is satisfaction e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if not in abundance.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> Nor doth that limb of discourse soon after following, in several veins of it become a man entrusted with the honour and glory of God in the Ministery of the Gospel. Here he tells me, that he <hi>must tell me that the unworthiness</hi> of those, who upon their invitation to the marriage-feast, refused to come, <hi>though it were the meritorious cause of their exclusion, yet was not the sole</hi> [who ever dream't it to be?] <hi>nor yet as much as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cause.</hi> Why not, Mr. <hi>K. as much as the principal cause?</hi> or rather why nor the <hi>principal cause</hi> it self? Hear a profound reason given of that which is not. <hi>For that</hi> (saith he) <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65873:256"/> this unworthiness, the King, had he pleased might have both remitted it, and reformed it.</hi> In this reason, there is neither reason nor truth. But let us hear him out, and then answer. He goeth on; <hi>Will you say the King could not have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pardoned, or purged this unworthiness? It is clear</hi> [with Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> clearness when he is in the dark] <hi>that he could have done both. And therefore it was not so much this their unworthiness, as the Kings intendment thus to proceed against them for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness, which was the true and proper cause of their exclusion.</hi> He hath not yet done with the businesse, the principal part of his answer, a silly jear, is yet behind. <hi>You have done very worthily</hi> (saith he) <hi>in ascribing all</hi> to their <hi>own unworthiness, and exempting the Kings intendment to exclude them, from being any cause of it.</hi> Now to answer.</p>
               <p>First, A little more partnership in that properry of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, which denominates God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i.</hi> uncapable of lying, would much adorn Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> learning and parts. I no where <hi>exempt the Kings intendment</hi> to exclude them from all causality, of, or about, their exclusion. If he had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced any words of mine, wherein I either affirm, or imply, such a thing, he had both provided for the salvage of his own credit &amp; conscience, from the dishonourable guilt of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his saying, who was a liar from the beginning; and had cast the disparagement of an inconsiderate speaker upon me. But not having done this, he stands obnoxious to the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned imputation, and I am yet, though not unaccused, yet untoucht with any proof of the accusation brought against me.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Wheras he gives this for a reason, why the <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness</hi> of those, who being invited, refused to come, could <hi>not be the principal cause of their exclusion, viz.</hi> because, <hi>notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this unworthiness, the King, had he pleased, might have both remitted it, and reformed it,</hi> doth he speak any good <hi>reason,</hi> yea or so much as common sense? Suppose the last man that met Mr. <hi>K.</hi> in the streets, might, <hi>if he had pleased,</hi> have stab'd him, and taken away his life (and the supposition may very possibly be true) doth this prove, that because he did it not, he is the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65873:257"/>
                  <hi>principal cause</hi> why Mr. <hi>K.</hi> keeps possession of his life, or why he liveth? Or are, or were, they who made the Law, by which robbing upon the high-way, or Burglary, are made pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable by death, the <hi>principal cause,</hi> why those who commit these crimes, are put to death; because, <hi>had they pleased,</hi> they might have waved or declined the making of such Laws? I see the Deans chair did not prompt or inspire Mr. <hi>K.</hi> with any regular notion of <hi>Causa principalis.</hi> Is he that hath no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, the <hi>principal cause</hi> of his dying? Or is he, that endeavoured by all ways and means, that were meet to be used by him in order to such a thing, that those who at last were excluded from the supper, might not have been excluded, but prevailed with to have come, is he (I say) to be judged the <hi>principal cause</hi> of their exclusion? Or in case Mr. <hi>K.</hi> should lead his horse to the water, and his horse notwithstanding should refuse to drink, and die for his not drinking, were Mr. <hi>K.</hi> the <hi>principal cause</hi> either of his horses refusing to drink, or of his dying upon it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <hi>had he pleased,</hi> he might have poured water down his throat? And what though God might, <hi>had he pleased both have remitted and reformed the unworthiness of the excluded?</hi> must these prerogatives of his intitle him to the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of causality in or about the ruine of his creature; Wherein notwithstanding he disclaimeth, and this with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, that men should think otherwise of him, to have any hand at all with any pleasure, or delight? Was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver such a <hi>principal cause</hi> heard of, which had no inclination or propension towards the production of the effect produced by it? But no great marvel if Mr. <hi>K.</hi> fails in his Logick, when as he faulters in his mother-tongue. Or is this good English; <hi>notwithstanding this unworthiness, the King, had he pleased, might have both remitted it, and reformed it?</hi> Or is not such a saying, parallel with this? notwithstanding <hi>Davids</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, God, <hi>had he pleased,</hi> might have both remitted <hi>Davids</hi> adultery, and reformed it? Or with this; notwithstanding Mr. <hi>Ks. unworthiness</hi> in childish and vain jesting and jearing, God, did he please, might both remit this <hi>unworthiness</hi> of his,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65873:257"/> and reform it? I heartily wish that he will please to do both; I mean, both to remit and reform the said <hi>unworthiness,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the said <hi>unworthiness.</hi> But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When he saith, that <hi>the King had he pleased, might <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> have both remitted, and reformed the unworthiness of those that were excluded;</hi> his own principles and sayings elsewhere will con him small thanks for so saying: For I presume, that by those, who were <hi>excluded</hi> by the King, and concerning whom he said, that they <hi>should never tast of his Supper,</hi> himself under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth onely Reprobates, <hi>i.</hi> such, for whom [in his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie] <hi>Christ</hi> never died. Now that God may, if he please, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> the sins of those, for whom no atonement hath been made by <hi>Christ,</hi> is it not a notion or saying, that casts the gauntlet of defiance to a darling piece of his Divinity? which he presenteth in a dish of jears to his Reader, in these words. If <hi>Mr.</hi> Goodwin, <hi>or any of his acquaintance could have been saved without Christs actual dying, yet we poor wretches humbly acknowledge, that nothing less then his precious blood could have satisfied for the least of our sins; had not he died, wo had been us that ever we were born: had not he actually died, we could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been saved. Such as Mr.</hi> Goodwin, &amp;c.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Request to the Reader. p. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> It seems by Mr <hi>Ks.</hi> Doctrine, the passage now transcribed, and the words yet under examination, compared, that the Elect could not, but the Reprobates might have been saved without Christs actual dying for them. For, the <hi>poor wretches</hi> he speaks of (in the passage last transcribed) amongst whom he includes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (as the pronoun, <hi>we,</hi> informeth us) we must needs presume to be of the <hi>Elect:</hi> and yet of these (as we heard) he expresly saith, that <hi>had not Christ actually died, they could not possibly have been saved</hi> [It seems then, to note this by the way, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of your Decree of Election depends upon <hi>Christs</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dying for you, and doth not carry your Salvation before it with that absoluteness, which sometimes you pretend.] But speaking of those who were by the King <hi>excluded</hi> from the marriage-feast, by whom (as was said) he cannot imagine any others, but Reprobates, to be signified, yet concerning these he saith, that the King [by whom in the sequel of his
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65873:258"/> discourse he reminds me over and over as if I forgat it, that God is represented] <hi>might, had he pleased, have remitted their unworthiness.</hi> Certainly if God, <hi>did he please,</hi> may <hi>remit the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness</hi> of Reprobates, for whom Mr. <hi>Ks.</hi> Divinity c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ieth aloud, and this ten times over, that <hi>Christ</hi> did not die he may also save them. For there is nothing standeth in any mans way to hinder his salvation but his <hi>unworthiness,</hi> and his sin: and if these be <hi>remitted,</hi> they are taken out of the way, and so his title to salvation becomes clear and unquestionable. But</p>
               <p>Fourthly Besides the contradictiousness of the saying now under contest, unto the fundamentalls of his own Faith (as we have heard) it is broadly inconsistent with my Faith also, and with the truth. For the tenour of my Faith (as to the point in hand) is, First, that the persons <hi>excluded</hi> the King from the marriage-feast, were in an estate of impenitency and unbelief. Secondly, that God hath revealed and declared his will to be, that the sin o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> unworthiness of no impenitent person, or unbeliever, shall be remitted: and consequently that the King in the Parable, could no more, if he should <hi>have pleased,</hi> have <hi>remitted</hi> the unworthiness of those that were <hi>excluded,</hi> then, if he should please, deny himself. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less whatsoever God hath revealed to be his will and pleasure to do is most agreeable to his nature and being: and to say, that if he please, he may do any thing contrary hereunto, or that which is less, or not at all, agreeable unto his nature, is a saying most unworthy of him, and il-becoming both the lips, and pen, of him that undertakes to declare his Name unto the world. Notwithstanding</p>
               <p>Fifthly, (and lastly) as if all that I have argued from the Marriage-feast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad been but as <hi>dust to his sword, or driven stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his bow,</hi> he be-jears me over and over; First, somewhat more gently: Secondly somewhat more liberally (or il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberally rather:) but Thirdly, (and lastly) nothing less then scurrilously. First he tells me, <hi>I have done very worthily</hi> [his good meaning is the quite contrary way] <hi>in ascribing all to their own unworthiness,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, his next festival address to me is this: <hi>And so all this while you have little cause to cheer
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65873:258"/> your self too much with any thing you have recovered as yet at this marriage-feast:</hi> and yet presently after, that <hi>I seem to have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a piece of veal.</hi> But thirdly, and lastly, he complements me thus (as upon another occasion I have signified) <hi>And for your part, you have told your tale so well that you may challenge, as for a Christmass one, according to the guise of my Devon, a mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of mustard, and a shoe full of custard.</hi> This is (well nigh) his constant <hi>guise,</hi> when he hath talked himself weary, though never so weakly, never so impertinently, never so absurdly, to refresh himself with a <hi>merry frolick</hi> (as he terms it in the close) and in stead of <hi>Io Paean,</hi> to triumph in some vilifying and ridiculous conceit or other in the winding up: supposing (as it seems) that with injudicious and less-observant Readers (for whose Meridian both his books seem to be more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly calculated) a triumph and a conquest will pass for as perfect relatives, as consequent and antecedent, or a bush at the door, and wine in the cellar. For my charity will hardly indulge him with so good an opinion of his ingenuity, as to think that his design in making sport and pleasance so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently at the end of his respective veins, or limbs of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, is to cause his Reader to forget his sorrow, that he met with so little to any purpose in the premisses, but had lost his time in reading them.</p>
               <p>The intent of my present debates with Mr. <hi>K.</hi> onely was to draw his pourtraicture, and this as near to the life as I could, with his own colours, and to present it unto the Reader. I doubt not but by the feature and complexion of it, he will perfectly understand what manner of man Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is, in his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, spirit, parts, learning, abilities for the managing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies which he hath undertaken. If the Reader be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly satisfied about these, I am satisfied for my pains and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the work, with his satisfaction.</p>
               <p>And now I have done with Mr. <hi>K.</hi> wishing from my soul that Doctor <hi>K.</hi> may prove a better and wiser man. In the mean time I shall arm my self with Master <hi>Baxters</hi> resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to come any more so near him, <hi>until his breath be
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65873:259"/> sweeter;</hi> untill I shall understand that his language and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of discourse, shall be changed from careless, light, and scurrilous, into that which is digested, grave, and serious; and such which becomes so majestick, so awfull and tremend a Subject, and unsearchable riches of the Grace, love, and wisdom of God in the salvation of the world.</p>
